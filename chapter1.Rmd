#Introduction
In the modern world, technological developments are making it possible to collect increasing amounts of data on many aspects of our lives. Large microeconomic datasets provide an opportunity to improve the measurement of a range of economic phenomena and to bolster economic research [@Schutt2013]. Microdata alone is of little use if it cannot be properly aggregated, analysed and communicated to policy makers [@Tissot2016]. The abundance of inexpensive computing power is making it possible to process these large amounts of data to provide useful information and to try to distinguish the signal from the noise. There are always practical challenges in aggregating information and in identifying the signal or underlying pattern in the data.

One way in which these large amounts of microeconomic data can aid economic analysis is to construct better macroeconomic indicators. The primary aim of this dissertation is to use three relatively large microdata sets to create macroeconomic time series indicators. The idea is to use the richness of granular microdata to improve on the quality and the accuracy of macro statistics [@Tissot2016]. All three datasets have shortcomings which make it challenging to estimate time series indicators. The dissertation uses similar aggregation and estimation techniques, in some cases for the first time in the South African context, to create useful macroeconomic indicators. The secondary aim of the dissertation is to use these indicators, as well as the underlying data, to answer a specific question in each case. 

The first case investigates business sentiment in South Africa. This chapter estimates indicators of business confidence and uncertainty for South Africa (1992Q1-2015Q3), using the Bureau for Economic Research's (BER) business tendency surveys. The sentiment indicators are then used to examine the relationship between business sentiment and real activity in South Africa. The second case investigates the South African art market. This chapter estimates South African art price indices (2000Q1-2015Q4), using a relatively large database of art auction prices. The art price indices are then used to look for evidence of a bubble in South African art prices. The third case investigates historical commodity prices in the Cape Colony. This chapter estimates monthly wholesale price indices for the Cape Colony (1889/10-1914/08), using a high-frequency dataset on commodity prices. The high-frequency prices are the used to examine internal market integration in the Cape Colony over this period.

The three chapters follow the same structure. First, similar techniques are used to aggregate the relatively large datasets, to form three sets of macroeconomic indicators: sentiment indices, art price indices, and wholesale commodity price indices. These aggregation techniques (e.g. repeat sales methods and cross-sectional moments) may prove useful in other research settings where there are similar challenges. Second, the indicators compared to local and international time series to see if they are plausible. Third, the ability of the indicators to improve on the existing series and to provide additional insight in each case is evaluated. Finally, the indicators and underlying data are used to answer a specific question in each case. This illustrates how the indicators might be used to aid the economic analysis. The estimated indicators are presented in the appendix of each chapter. The hope is that researchers will find the estimated time series useful for future research in these areas. 

##Business Sentiment
The global financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession were associated with exceptionally low levels of confidence and heightened uncertainty. According to the @ECB2013, weak business sentiment contributed to a large extent to the Great Recession and the lacklustre subsequent recovery. The idea that weak business sentiment influenced economic activity has motivated a large body of literature investigating the impact of changes in business sentiment, and especially uncertainty, on real economic activity. Yet to date there has been little research on business sentiment in South Africa. It is important to confirm the existence and nature of the relationship between sentiment and economic activity in developing countries, which often face higher uncertainty than developed countries [@Bloom2014].

Empirical work on business sentiment faces two main challenges. The first is that sentiment is an elusive concept that is difficult to define precisely or measure directly, which makes it difficult to construct proxies for confidence and uncertainty [@Santero1996]. The second is that it is challenging to identify a separate causal impact for sentiment on real economic activity [@Bloom2014]. 

Only two business confidence indicators are regularly published for South Africa: the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry Business Confidence Index (SACCI BCI) and the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index (BER BCI). The SACCI BCI is a composite measure of economic activity, rather than a confidence indicator in the way it is defined in the literature. The BER BCI is derived from the BER's business tendency surveys [@Kershoff2015]. The BER BCI is based on a single question on current conditions. The survey responses are weighted in an ad hoc manner and the services sector survey is excluded from the calculation. Only a few studies have created proxies for uncertainty in South Africa (e.g. @Redl2015 and @Hlatshwayo2016). The existing proxies capture different aspects of uncertainty, but none has fully exploited the information contained in the BER business tendency surveys to construct proxies for business uncertainty in South Africa. 

The primary aim of this chapter is to try to improve on the existing measures of sentiment for South Africa, using the microdata from the BER's business tendency surveys. Although measuring business sentiment is not straightforward, survey-based indicators can be helpful in discovering agents' opinions on future economic developments [@OECD2003]. Survey-based measures have the advantage that they are derived from opinions of key economic agents [@Girardi2015], are available earlier than official statistics and are usually not subject to revisions [@ECB2013]. The challenge is to create improved indicators from the qualitative business tendency surveys, which incorporate more of the available information.

This chapter calculates composite indicators of business confidence and uncertainty. The composite indicators incorporate the survey responses from a number of questions, maintaining a distinction between current and expected future conditions. The responses are systematically weighted to produce sectoral and aggregate indicators, which are analysed separately. The indices also incorporate the services sector, which is not currently part of the BER BCI. The composite confidence indicators are calculated as the cross-sectional mean of responses to questions on current and expected future business conditions [@OECD2003]. The composite uncertainty indicators are calculated as the cross-sectional dispersion of forward-looking responses and the cross-sectional mean and dispersion of individual firm expectation errors [@Arslan2011; @Bachmann2013; @Girardi2015]. In addition, the paper constructs a composite overall measure of uncertainty, which combines the survey-based uncertainty indicators with financial market uncertainty and the economic policy uncertainty indicator created by @Hlatshwayo2016. 

The composite confidence and uncertainty indicators are compared to the existing measures for South Africa to see if they are plausible. The sentiment indicators are then evaluated in terms of how well they track the reference series, i.e. according to their comovement with real GDP growth, to see if they are able to improve upon the existing indicators and provide additional insight. The new confidence indicators track real GDP growth closely and seem to improve on the existing measures. The uncertainty indicators seem to capture different aspects of uncertainty. A combination of the different indicators appears to be the most plausible proxy for uncertainty in South Africa, reflecting key economic events. It also appears to track real GDP growth rates more closely than any of the individual indicators separately.

There has been very little analysis of the impact of business sentiment indicators on real economic activity in the South African context (e.g. @Pellissier2002 and @Redl2015). The secondary aim of this chapter is to examine the relationship between business sentiment and real activity in South Africa, using the standard VAR framework. The chapter tries to establish if there is a significant relationship between the indicators and real GDP growth, the timing of this relationship, and if it remains significant after taking other economic variables into account. 

The composite confidence indicators exhibit a significant positive correlation with real GDP growth. The indicators provide advanced warning of turning points in the business cycle, although there are a few false positives. The results suggested that the survey-based confidence indicators contain relevant information for predicting output growth. A shock to the confidence indicators was followed by a significant increase in real GDP growth in the VAR models. This was the case for the aggregate indicators as well as the sectoral indicators. This implies that these confidence indicators are potentially useful for monitoring economic developments in a timely manner and for forecasting future economic activity. The new composite indicators seem to outperform the existing confidence indicators, in terms of tracking record, identifying turning points, and the size of impulse responses.

The composite uncertainty indicators exhibit a significant negative correlation with real GDP growth, albeit at different horizons. Shocks to uncertainty are generally followed by a decrease in real GDP growth. The combined composite uncertainty indicator that incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty seems to exhibit a stronger relationship with real GDP growth than any of the measures separately. 

Overall, the rudimentary evidence seems to indicate that there is at least strong comovement between the indicators and economic activity, and that they contain potentially useful predictive information. The findings seem to be robust to the inclusion of additional economic variables. The impact of shocks to the sentiment indicators are larger on real production and investment growth than on real GDP growth, as theory would predict [@Bloom2009].

##Art Prices
Contemporary African art has experienced a surge in popularity over the last few decades. The South African art market in particular has received a lot of attention, and has grown markedly over the last two decades, both in terms of the number of transactions and total turnover [@Fedderke2014]. Yet to date there has been little research on the South African art market and particularly trends in art prices. It is important to analyse price movements over time in order to understand the development and the dynamics of the market. 

Estimating accurate price indices for unique items such as artworks can be challenging [@Jiang2014]. Artworks are less liquid than traditional assets and have a low transaction frequency, which means that only a small part of the overall market is traded at any given time, while the prices of non-transacted items are unobservable. Artworks are typically unique or heterogeneous, which means that the quality of items sold is not constant over time. The composition of items sold will generally differ between periods, making it difficult to compare prices over time [@Hansen2009]. These features present challenges to measuring the state of the overall market over time.

The primary aim of this chapter is to construct quality-adjusted South African art price indices, using a relatively large database of auction prices. This is the first price index for South African art, of the type often estimated internationally (e.g. @Mei2002, @Renneboog2002, and @Kraussl2014). 

This chapter uses three broad methodologies to develop price indices for South African art: central tendency methods, hedonic methods and hybrid repeat sales methods. Simple central tendency indices are estimated as a baseline to compare the results from the different methodologies. The chapter argues that central tendency measures do not adequately control for quality-mix or compositional changes over time. Various indices are estimated with the hedonic regression method, which is able to control more adequately for quality-mix changes by attributing implicit prices to a set of characteristics. The hedonic indices seem to paint a relatively consistent picture of the trend in South African art prices over time. The main shortcoming of the hedonic method is that it has potential omitted variable bias, which might bias the indices, as many of the artwork attributes are not observed. 

The repeat sales method provides an alternative estimation method for quality-adjusted price indices. Repeat sales indices suffer less from potential omitted variable bias, but have the shortcoming of potential sample selection bias. The repeat sales method controls for quality-mix changes by tracking the same asset over time. Hence, it utilises only artworks that have sold more than once. The scarcity of repeat sales observations in the database limits the usefulness of the classical repeated sales approach in this case. The chapter therefore proposes a simple new hybrid or pseudo-repeat sales method as an alternative. This approach acts as a type of robustness test. It addresses the problem of scarcity of repeat sales observations and to some extent the potential omitted variable bias inherent in the hedonic method.

The various art price indices are compared to each other, as well as to international art price indices and other South African assets, to see if they provide consistent and plausible results. The indices estimated with the regression-based methods seem to point to the same general trend in South African art prices. This provides some confidence that potential omitted variable bias and sample selection bias are not pervasive in this case, or dictating the results [@Calomiris2016]. The trends seem plausible, although they exhibit a more dramatic price increase in the run-up to the financial crisis than the other assets. The regression-based indices differ markedly from the central tendency indices, which demonstrates the importance of adjusting for quality-mix changes when producing price indices. 

The indices are then evaluated directly in terms of smoothness or signal-to-noise metrics (i.e. lower random noise in the indices). This is relatively new, as studies typically use one method to estimate the indices and then typically evaluate the underlying regressions. The smoothness metrics suggest that the 1-year adjacent period hedonic index performs the best, although the regression-based indices provide similar results. 

According to the price indices there was a large increase in South African art prices in the run-up to the Great Recession. The secondary aim of the chapter is to study the estimated art price indices for evidence of a bubble. The challenge for art is that it is difficult to estimate a fundamentals value. The chapter turns to the direct bubble detection tests proposed by @Phillips2011 to investigate whether South African art prices exhibited mildly explosive behaviour over the period. The method involves recursive Augmented-Dickey-Fuller autoregressive tests, which allows the identification of mildly explosive subsamples in the series. Following @Kraussl2016, this test is performed on the art price indices.

The results indicate that there is evidence of bubble-like behaviour in all of the regression-based art price indices. The regression-based indices provide relatively consistent results in terms of the explosive periods in the South African art market, with a potential bubble most likely beginning in 2006 and ending in 2008. The bubble detection tests performed on the different market segments indicate that the bubble process was relatively dispersed throughout the market, although prices seem to have been especially explosive for high-end oil paintings by top artists. 

##Historical Commodity Prices
Recently, there has been what @Fourie2016 calls a data revolution in African Economic History. Over the past two decades the increase in access to online resources, data-processing software and computing power has enabled scholars to capture and analyse historical statistics on a much larger scale than before. Historical statistics are often available only at an annual frequency. While lower frequency data can identify longer term trends, higher frequency data allow a more detailed investigation of price histories, business cycles, and market behaviour in general. Reliable higher frequency data can clarify our understanding of the economic impact of many important historical events [@Mitchell2012]. 

This chapter attempts to make a contribution to the quantitative history of the Cape Colony using a newly digitised historical dataset of high frequency (i.e. monthly) prices from 1889 to 1914. The turn of the 20th century was a period of huge structural change in South Africa. The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 fundamentally altered the structure of the economy from essentially pastoral to mining-intensive. Over this period the Cape Colony is an interesting example of an early capitalistic economy, where internationalisation and market integration were beginning to take hold [@Boshoff2015]. 

The primary aim of this chapter is to develop monthly wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony, of the type often used in the older economic literature (e.g. @Schumann1938, @Friedman1952 and @Friedman1963). There is no wholesale price index for the Cape Colony over this period, a fact bemoaned by @Schumann1938. The indices are based on the monthly market prices of agricultural products in various towns reported in the Agricultural Journals of the Department of Agriculture. The high frequency prices are supplemented with annual market prices for agricultural products in various towns reported in the Cape Colony Blue Books. This allows the inclusion of a number of important products, such as wool and hides, which are omitted from the Agricultural Journals. 

The challenge in creating monthly wholesale price indices is that the data is incomplete, in terms of the coverage of both products and towns. @Klovland2014a showed that the repeat sales method, which is typically used to create indices for infrequently traded items, such as artworks, may be used to deal with incomplete data in this context. The repeat sales methodology provides a consistent way to aggregate the price data and produces indices with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series. 

The chapter applies the repeat sales method to estimate monthly wholesale commodity price indices for a number of individual products. The individual product price indices are intended to shed light on the demand and supply conditions for the various agricultural products, especially around the Second South African War (1899-1902). The product indices are then aggregated to form indices of broader product groups, as well as an overall wholesale commodity price index. The weights are based on production values reported in the 1904 census, as well as import values reported in the Blue Books. This is the first monthly wholesale price index for the Cape Colony over that period. It is intended to provide some new insight into the inflation history of the period. 

The wholesale price indices seem to correspond quite well with the historical narrative on the economic history of the Cape Colony. In general, prices seem to have been highly cyclical over the period, with a large increase before and during the Second South African War (1899-1902) and a large decrease up to Unification (1910). In wartime periods the price level may be among the few series that can be measured accurately, and may convey information on the state of the economy [@Klovland2014a]. 

To gauge if they provide reasonable results, the wholesale price indices are compared to existing consumer price indices for the Cape Colony and to wholesale price indices for the UK and the US. In both cases the estimated price indices seem plausible, but with a larger increase before the Second South African War (1899-1902). The indices are then compared to the available monetary aggregates and evaluated according to whether they conform to the quantity theory of money. The overall wholesale price index seems to better reflect the monetary history of the Cape Colony than the existing CPIs.

Following @Ruch2016, the high-frequency prices are used to gain some insight into the pricing behaviour over this period (i.e. the size and frequency price changes). Monthly changes were dominated by zero or small changes, with around 86% of changes smaller than 10% in either direction. The frequency of price changes was relatively high, with prices changing on average every 50 days. This information is used to calculate an alternative measure of inflation, which is decomposed into flexible and sticky components, to provide further insight into the price history of the period. 

There is a large international literature on market integration, but relatively little is known about internal market integration in the Cape Colony around the turn of the 20th century (e.g. @Boshoff2015). During this period the mineral revolution led to the rapid expansion of the railway network and created a potentially large internal market [@Schumann1938]. Integrated markets should generate important benefits for an economy, including greater regional specialisation, economies of scale, increased investment opportunities, and greater incentives for innovation and technical progress [@Andrabi2010].

The secondary aim of this chapter is to use the high-frequency price data to investigate internal market integration in the Cape Colony. Market integration is a twofold process. The first dimension concerns how close prices are throughout the economy for the same goods. Market integration along this dimension features a decline in price gaps or dispersion. Falling transport costs should lead to less price dispersion and better integrated markets [@Andrabi2010]. It is instructive to study this period during which there was rapid development of the railway infrastructure in the Cape Colony. The second dimension features increase in the speed of return to equilibrium price gaps after a shock, i.e. "efficiency", which is the outcome of arbitrage by profit-seeking traders [@Federico2013]. 

This chapter builds on the work of @Boshoff2015, by expanding the period and the number of products, and focusing specifically on the first dimension of market integration, i.e. price convergence. The chapter calculates measures of cross-sectional price gaps and cross-sectional price dispersion between the towns in the Cape Colony. According to these measures, most of the commodity prices seem to have been converging over the period. This implies that there was increasing market integration between towns in the Cape Colony, in all likelihood aided by the rapid development of the railway network.

##Objectives and Contributions
The specific questions addressed in the dissertation are the following: 

1. Business Sentiment:

    1.1.	How do we aggregate qualitative business tendency surveys to construct sentiment indicators? 

    1.2.	What happened to business confidence and uncertainty in South Africa over time? 

    1.3.	Is there evidence of significant co-movement between the sentiment indicators and real activity?

2. Art Prices:

    2.1.	How do we aggregate auction prices for unique artworks to construct art price indices? 

    2.2.	What happened to art prices in South Africa over time? 

    2.3.	Is there evidence of a bubble in art prices over the period?

3. Historical Commodity Prices:

    3.1.	How do we aggregate high-frequency prices with missing values to construct wholesale price indices? 

    3.2.	What happened to wholesale prices in the Cape Colony over time? 

    3.3.	Is there evidence of increasing market integration over the period?

More generally, the dissertation tries to contribute to the literature by demonstrating suitable aggregation and estimation techniques to overcome some of the challenges in aggregating relatively large datasets. In some cases these techniques are applied to the South African setting for the first time. Some of the techniques are used in more than one of the cases. The repeat sales methodology is used to construct quality-adjusted art price indices, as well as wholesale commodity price indices. Cross-sectional means and standard deviations are used to construct sentiment indicators (confidence and uncertainty), as well as measures of market dispersion (coefficient of variation). 

These aggregation techniques may prove useful in a variety of settings where there are similar challenges. For instance, the weighted cross-sectional moments employed in this dissertation could prove useful for other applications where there are qualitative survey responses (e.g. consumer surveys). Using these techniques, it might be possible to improve on the exiting measures of consumer confidence, as well as create new measures of consumer uncertainty.

The repeat sales and hedonic methods employed in this dissertation would be useful in constructing indices for other unique assets, such as real estate, antiques and wine. Indices for these assets, and particularly real estate, should be corrected for quality-mix changes over time. ABSA, FNB and Standard Bank currently only use stratified central tendency methods to construct their property price indices for South Africa. The central tendency method does not adequately control for quality-mix changes and could be improved with repeat sales and hedonic methods [@Els2010]. The repeat sales method may prove useful in other historical applications, where the information is often patchy and incomplete. It provides a simple and consistent way to overcome some of the problems with aggregating incomplete information.

The primary objective of the dissertation is to create useful macroeconomic time series from the relatively large microdata sets: sentiment indices, art price indices, and historical wholesale commodity price indices. In a sense the time series try to establish some stylised facts in each of the three fields. The estimated time series are reported in the appendix of each chapter and each chapter presents some suggested potential future research. The hope is that the indicators will prove useful for further research in each of these fields.
