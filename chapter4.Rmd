#Commodity Prices in the Cape Colony, 1889-1914
##Introduction
Recently there has been, what @Fourie2016 calls, a data revolution in African economic history. Over the past two decades the increase in access to online resources, data-processing software and computing power has enabled scholars to capture and analyse historical statistics on Africa on a much larger scale than before. One example is the Colonial Blue Books, a large collection of reports containing records of Cape government revenue and expenditure, imports and exports, and other statistics. These data sources can now be used to study incomes and living standards, education and fiscal systems, and transportation networks of African societies (e.g., @DeZwart2011, @Greyling2015, and @Fourie2015). 

Historical statistics, and higher frequency records in particular, are often incomplete [@Klovland2014a]. Even if sources are available on a continual basis there will inevitably be cases when a particular data series was discontinued or contains substantial gaps. These problems make it challenging to aggregate the incomplete data to form relatively continuous time series. 

The primary aim of this chapter is to explore aggregation methods to develop relatively continuous monthly wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony, using incomplete historical records. The indices are based on an expanded version of the historical dataset used in @Boshoff2017. The records consist of monthly prices in various towns in the Cape Colony from 1889 to 1914 reported in the Agricultural Journals of the Department of Agriculture. The analysis is supplemented by incorporating annual market prices reported in the Cape Colony Blue Books, which allows the inclusion of a number of important products. The challenge in aggregating the datasets is that both sets of records are incomplete, in terms of the coverage of both products and towns.

@Klovland2014a showed that the repeat sales method, which is typically used to create indices for infrequently traded items, such as artworks, may be used to deal with incomplete data in this context. The chapter demonstrates the use of the repeat sales method to aggregate the incomplete data to form relatively continuous time series. It provides a consistent way to aggregate the price data and produces indices with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series. The method is similar to the hedonic and hybrid repeat sales methods used in chapter 2, as it calculates the mean in the distribution of growth rates.

The chapter applies the repeat sales method to estimate monthly wholesale commodity price indices for a number of individual products. Higher frequency records allow a more detailed investigation of price histories, business cycles, and market behaviour in general [@Mitchell2012]. The product indices provide information on supply and demand conditions for the various agricultural products. The product indices are then aggregated to form indices of broader product groups, as well as a total commodity price index. The weights are based on production values reported in the 1904 census, as well as import values reported in the Blue Books. To date there has been little research on prices during this period, in part due to a lack of records on prices, and no wholesale commodity price index exists for the Cape Colony before 1910. The price indices correspond well with the historical narrative on the economic history of the Cape Colony, with a large increase before and during the Second South African War (1899-1902) and a large decrease up to Unification (1910). 

In order to gauge the external validity of the price indices, the chapter tests conformity to existing measures of the price level. In the absence of an existing monthly commodity price index for the Cape Colony over the period, the price indices are compared to existing annual consumer price indices. As will be shown, available wholesale price indices for the UK and the US provide another external validity check for the wholesale price indices. The indices are then evaluated according to whether they conform to the path implied by available monetary aggregates. The total wholesale price index seems to better reflect the monetary history of the Cape Colony than the existing CPIs. 

Following @Ruch2016, the high-frequency prices are used to gain some insight into the pricing behaviour over this period (i.e. the size and frequency price changes). This information is used to calculate a simple alternative measure of overall inflation, which is provides an internal validity check for the total wholesale commodity price index.

The secondary aim of this chapter is to use the high-frequency price data to investigate internal market integration in the Cape Colony. There is a large international literature on market integration, but very few studies have considered internal market integration in the Cape Colony around the turn of the 20th century (e.g. @Boshoff2017). During this period the mineral revolution led to the rapid expansion of the railway network and created a potentially large internal market [@Schumann1938].

Market integration concerns the convergence of prices for the same goods are throughout the economy [@Andrabi2010], as well as the efficiency with which price gaps return to equilibrium after a shock [@Federico2013]. Higher-frequency data can aid the investigation along both dimensions [@Ejrnæs2008]. This part of the chapter builds on the work of @Boshoff2017, by expanding the period and the number of products, and considering on both dimensions of market integration (i.e. convergence and efficiency). 

The chapter studies regional wholesale price indices, as well as measures of cross-sectional price dispersion between the towns in the Cape Colony, for evidence of increasing internal market integration. The chapter test the hypotheses that price dispersion between towns was declining over the period and that regional prices indices were cointegrated. The cross-sectional measures of price dispersion, such as the coefficient of variation, are related to the measures used in chapter 3. According to these measures many of the commodity prices were converging over the period. A number of regional commodity price indices were cointegrated over the period. This implies that there was increasing market integration between towns in the Cape Colony.

The following section discusses the economic history of prices the Cape Colony between the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 and the start of WWI in 1914. The idea is to provide some context for the subsequent investigation of the price history of the Cape Colony over the period.

##Economic History of Prices in the Cape Colony: 1886-1914
The turn of the 20th century was a period of structural change in South Africa. The discovery of gold in 1886 fundamentally altered the structure of the economy from essentially pastoral to mining-intensive. Within a few decades the predominantly agricultural economy was transformed into a market and credit economy in which capital-intensive mineral production was of significant importance [@Schumann1938]. The Second South African War (1899-1902) fundamentally altered the region, and led to the formation of the Union of South Africa from the four colonies in 1910. The mineral revolution created an urgent need for an efficient means of transportation of goods and passengers between the coastal ports and the mining towns in the interior. The result was a rapid expansion of the railway network and a decline in transportation costs [@DeKock1924]. The Cape Colony is an interesting example of an early capitalistic economy over this period, where internationalisation and internal market integration was just beginning to take hold [@Boshoff2017].

###Overview of Cape Economic Activity
The seminal works of @DeKock1924 and @Schumann1938 discuss the economic history of the South African colonies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These studies provide similar narratives of the economic development of South Africa around that period. More recently, @Greyling2015 calculated GDP estimates for the Cape Colony, to facilitate the analysis of long-term growth and development in the Cape Colony. This section provides a brief description of the economic history of the period (i.e. GDP growth, inflation, imports and exports), by relating the historical narratives to the quantitative evidence from the GDP estimates. 

Figure 4.1 illustrates the real GDP estimates for the Cape Colony reported in @Greyling2015, with recessionary periods shaded. The turning points in the indicators are determined with the non-parametric dating algorithm, first suggested by @Bry1971, which automates the Burns & Mitchell approach to determining classical turning points. The algorithm identifies local minima (troughs) and maxima (peaks) in a logged time series. A censoring rule based on a minimum of 1 year for each phase and 2 years for a full cycle is used to ensure that phases and cycles have a minimum duration, as suggested by @Harding2002. The algorithm has the advantage that it is a simple, transparent, easily replicable, and provides intuitively appealing results [@DuPlessis2006]. Following @DuPlessis2006, the algorithm is applied to the log of real GDP, after subtracting a simple deterministic linear trend. The resulting turning points differ slightly from those derived by @Greyling2015 using the Baxter-King band-pass filter.

Taken as a whole the Cape Colony experienced relatively rapid expansion over this so-called "gold-mining" period, during which the structure of the economy transformed from an agricultural economy to an agricultural-mineral economy [@Schumann1938]. According to these estimates, the Cape Colony experienced 6 upswing phases and 6 downswing phases between 1886 and 1909, with the most severe recession during the Second South African War (1899-1902). These cycles correspond quite closely to the business cycle peaks in Britain [@Klovland2014a].

The discovery of gold was followed by an upswing phase, lasting roughly from 1888 to the end of 1890. During this period, there were large investments in the gold mining industry, a substantial proportion of which was directed through the Cape Colony banks. The prosperity was accompanied by speculation in gold shares and property, and easy credit extension by the banks [@Greyling2015]. 

This upswing phase was followed by a depression as the result of the financial and banking crisis in 1889-1890. The crisis was due to the overextension of credit and massive speculation in property and gold shares [@Schumann1938]. According to @Gilbert1933, the speculative bubble was burst by the realisation that many mines located on outside reefs would not be profitable and that deep level mining would have to be attempted by the mines on the reef. Most of the District Banks in the Cape got into financial difficulties and were absorbed by the larger banking institutions [@DeKock1924]. The crisis was intensified by the Baring crisis of 1890 in England. The price of gold shares, land and prospecting firms plummeted, while railway traffic, government revenue and imports declined marginally [@Greyling2015]. @Schumann1938 reports that the banks of the Cape felt the effects more severely than economic conditions in general. Agriculture in the Cape Colony did not suffer from the recession immediately, as the harvest prospects for 1890 were good. A relatively stagnant period followed, with a short upswing in 1893. 

There was another speculative boom in 1895, with large investments in the gold mining industry from abroad. According to @Schumann1938, this was followed by a relatively mild recession in 1896-97, although the GDP figures do not indicate a turning point. Political and natural factors contributed to the stagnant conditions in 1896 [@Gilbert1933]. The Jameson Raid at the start of 1896 had an unsettling effect on business conditions. Tensions between the Boer Republics and Britain led to the closure of the drifts in September and October 1895, disrupting road transport of goods into the interior and outward to the coastal ports. A severe drought in 1896 and the rinderpest cattle disease caused widespread livestock losses, especially in the interior [@Schumann1938; @DeKock1924].

Economic growth had just started to accelerate, when the outbreak of the Second South African War (1899-1902) caused a severe recession [@DeKock1924]. The war had a devastating effect on the economies of the Boer Republics. Agricultural prospects were severely hampered following the "scorched earth" policy of the British forces. This policy caused destruction of farm buildings, crops and livestock in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and to a lesser extent in parts of the Cape Colony and Natal. Gold mining in the Transvaal came to an almost complete standstill until 1902, with the value of gold production declining from £16m in 1898 to £1m in 1901 [@Schumann1938]. This had a large impact on monetary systems throughout the world, as noted in @Friedman1963's seminal study, "*The Monetary History of the United States*".

The large increase in expenditure by the British Government in connection with military operations created prosperity in parts of the Cape Colony and Natal, especially amongst the farming and trading communities. The war cost Great Britain around £250 million, of which a large proportion was spent in the Cape Colony and Natal to purchase agricultural and pastoral produce for the troops. Within a few months of the outbreak of the war, the number of British soldiers in South Africa increased to 130,000, and subsequently to around 250,000 (nearly 25% of the white population of the four territories combined) [@Schumann1938].

Figure 4.2 illustrates the imports and exports over the period. The Report on the Customs Transactions of the Colony for 1900 reported that the marked increase in imports into the Cape Colony was could be attributed to the large number of immigrant residents, expenditure on troops en route, and the restricted production of foodstuffs in the districts affected by the war. The increase in imports from 1899 to 1903 was due in large part to the increased imports of military supplies for the British troops [@Gilbert1933]. Expenditures by the British military therefore provided an injection for consumption and production in the Cape Colony and Natal [@Greyling2015]. 

At the same time, exports from Cape and Natal ports declined substantially, from almost £25m in 1898 to £7.5 in 1900, due to the increased local demand for produce and the temporary cessation of gold mining. The decline in exports did not seriously affect purchasing power abroad, as the large remittances of funds by the British Government from London to South Africa served to more than offset the reduction in value of the exports. The increase in imports and railway revenues, from the transport of troops and war materials, also enhanced the public revenues [@Schumann1938]. The war demand for goods and services therefore stimulated increases in prices and production in the Cape Colony [@DeKock1924]. According to the Cape Colony GDP estimates, the trough was reached already by the end of 1900.

g <- g + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + theme(legend.position="bottom")
g <- g + scale_y_continuous(name="Value (pounds)", labels = comma)
g
```

This was followed by relatively swift recovery and a robust upswing phase. According to @Schumann1938, the post-war boom was mainly the result of a general feeling of optimism, both in England and in South Africa, after the conclusion of the war. This optimism resulted in the extension of bank credit and speculation in property, as well as an increase in the importation of capital and goods to aid reconstruction. The reconstruction schemes, including a development loan of £3 million granted by the British Government, stimulated economic activity and a speculative environment [@DeKock1924]. Immigration also increased significantly after the war, presumably in search of mineral wealth, with 71,081 people landing at Cape ports in 1903, compared to 27,192 in 1908 [@Gilbert1933].

The post-war boom was short-lived. According to the GDP estimates, there was a mild recession from 1903 to the end of 1904. The recession was caused by a cyclical reaction to the large economic disequilibrium [@Schumann1938]. During the war, production and trade had increased due to the greater demand for foodstuffs and other commodities. After the war, production and trade increased further, based on the expected expansion and prosperity of gold and other industries. Despite the relatively early resumption of gold production, progress was hampered by a lack of unskilled labour. The inflow of purchasing power due to the war ended and large stocks of military goods were sold. When the expectations of growth were not fully realised, a long period of depression followed [@DeKock1924]. The recession may also in part be explained by the extensive destruction of the interior during the war [@Schumann1938]. 

After a brief upswing phase from 1905 to the end of 1906, another recession set in around 1907. The financial panic in Europe and America in 1907 and its effects on South African trade, as well as the drought of 1908, may also have contributed to the recession [@DeKock1924]. 

The recession seems to have lasted up to 1910, the year of the Unification of the four colonies, which was in line with reviving conditions in England [@Schumann1938]. The subsequent recovery period seems to have taken place up to the outbreak of WWI in 1914 (the end of the sample period). @DeKock1924 referred to this as the period of economic reorganisation, with an expansion in the agricultural, mining and manufacturing industries. The benefits of the construction of branch railway lines in many parts of the country promoted the development of farming enterprises. The gold industry was growing rapidly and the diamond industry had recovered quickly and resumed its progress. Although it was not a period of exceptional prosperity, conditions were generally fairly stable [@DeKock1924].

Overall, the turn of the 20th century was a turbulent period in South African history. Globalisation and the discovery of minerals transformed the Cape Colony into a prosperous exporting region with a steadily increasing GDP [@Fourie2015a]. The following section provides a brief description of the exiting research on prices and inflation in the Cape Colony over this period. 

###Overview of Research on Prices and Inflation 
No wholesale price index exists for the Cape Colony over the period, although a few studies have calculated consumer prices indices (CPIs). @Gilbert1933 computed a weighted aggregative index of the retail prices of 13 foods for the years 1883 to 1907. The figures were calculated as the average for 9 towns in the Cape Colony. The indices are only available graphically, and are reproduced in Figure 4.3. According to the index prices in the Cape Colony increased significantly during the two speculative booms in 1889 and 1895, and declined slightly during the recessionary or stagnant periods that followed. There was a rapid increase in prices during the war period and the post-war recovery. This was followed by a severe recession and swift decline that lasted at least to 1908. Similarly, @Schumann1938 reports that retail prices increased markedly during the war, with a peak in 1902, before decreasing until to 1909. 

![Cape Colony domestic retail price indices (1910=100)](Gilbert.png)

Figure 4.4 illustrates the annual CPI indices for the Cape Colony calculated by @DeZwart2011. To estimate the cost of living in the Cape Colony in the 19th century, @DeZwart2011 calculated CPI based on a "bare bones" and a "respectable" basket of consumption goods. This involved the creation of consumption baskets that reflected the consumption patterns of workers, as well as price series for the products in those baskets. The indices included 8 and 10 products[^33] respectively, based on the annual "average market prices of consumables", "average prices of agricultural produce" and import and export prices, as found in the Colonial Blue Books and Statistical tables. Because of missing data, it was necessary to interpolate and extrapolate a few of the series.

[^33]: These were: beef, bread or wheat, butter, candles, cheese, coal, cotton, peas and beans, fish, soap, wheat, and wine. The bare bones consumption basket reflected the cost of bare subsistence, while the respectable consumption basket included higher quantities of the products, as well as beef, cheese and wine instead of fish.

g <- g + labs(color="Legend text")
g <- g + geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Bare.Bones.Index, colour="Bare.Bones.Index"), size = 1)
g <- g + geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Respectable.Index, colour="Respectable.Index"), size = 1)
g <- g + geom_rect(data=tp, aes(xmin=Peaks, xmax=Troughs, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='grey', alpha=0.5)
g <- g + ylab("Consumer Price Indices") + xlab("")
g <- g + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
g <- g + scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date("1886-12-31"), as.Date("1913-12-31")),
                      labels = date_format("%Y"),breaks = date_breaks("year"))
g <- g + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + theme(legend.position="bottom")
g
```

As these indices were calculated to estimate the cost of living in the Cape Colony, they do not necessarily provide a consistent inflation history for the period. The respectable basket CPI seems to come closest to the inflation path implied by the historical narrative. The CPIs illustrate two of the main challenges with the historical statistics. First, they are often available only at an annual frequency, which means that high-frequency events cannot be analysed. Second, because the records are often incomplete, many series have to be interpolated and extrapolated to form continuous series.

The primary aim of the chapter is to explore aggregation methods to develop relatively continuous monthly wholesale commodity price index for the Cape Colony. Following @Klovland2014a, the repeat sales method is used to aggregate the incomplete price data to produces indices with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series. In order to gauge the external validity of the wholesale indices, they are compared to these existing measures of prices, as well as to trends in the money supply.

The following sections provide a brief description of potential drivers of prices over the period. The largest single economic event over the sample period was the Second South African War (1899-1902). The war involved large demand and supply shocks, which one would expect to have an impact on prices. Over the longer term, developments in the monetary and banking system, as well as the process of market integration, were potential drivers of prices.

###Exogenous Shock: The Second South African War (1899-1902)
The Second South African War (1899-1902), or Anglo-Boer War, was fought between Britain, with its two colonies (the Cape Colony and Natal), and the two independent Boer Republics (the South African Republic or Transvaal and the Orange Free State). It proved to be the longest (almost 3 years), costliest (over £200 million), bloodiest (estimates vary between 59,000-68,000 lives), and most humiliating colonial war for Britain between 1815 and 1914 [@Packenham1979]. @Marks2011 argues that the war as important in shaping modern South Africa as the American Civil War was for the United States. 

After the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, immigrants (labelled *Uitlanders*) poured into the Transvaal. The tensions around the franchise of the *Uitlanders*, many of whom were of British origin, became the main source of conflict between the Transvaal and British Governments and ostensibly the cause of the war. However, there were also wider considerations relating to the powerful financial interests around the control of the gold mines [@Marks2011]. Factors such as *Uitlander* grievances, tariffs, and monopolies were directly connected with gold mining interests. Any attempt by the British Government to gain concessions from the Transvaal Government made it the agent of the mining magnates [@DeKiewiet1941]. Moreover, Britain was pursuing its lengthy quest for a united South Africa [@DeKiewiet1941] and its need to assert itself in the face of economic competition from America and Germany [@Marks2011]. 

War was declared by the Boer Republics on 11 October 1899, after the expiry of President Kruger's ultimatum to the British government to withdraw all their troops from the border of the Transvaal. Kruger had hoped for a short war, like the clash with Britain in 1881, when the British quickly gave up the fight. This time round a long drawn-out war ensued, with numerous unforeseen consequences [@Fourie2015]. 

Within a year the British captured the capitals of the two Republics, Bloemfontein (on 13 March 1900) and Pretoria (on 5 June 1900), without meeting much resistance [@Fourie2014]. Contrary to expectations, however, this did not put an end to the war. There were too many areas still not under British control and the line of communication through the Orange Free State was poorly guarded and vulnerable [@Pretorius1998]. Hostilities lasted for another two years. Giving up on the impossible objective of trying to halt the British advance, Boer commando forces switched to guerrilla tactics [@Pretorius1998]. Moving in mobile commandos, Boer soldiers launched running attacks on British columns and supply lines [@Marks2011] and strategically intercepted British outposts over the Highveld terrain [@Fourie2014]. 

The British responded with a threefold strategy to end the war, involving block houses, intensifying the scorched earth policy and the use of concentration camps. Block houses were erected to protect strategic points such as bridges and railways, and as barriers to limit the free movement of the Boers across the countryside. The scorched earth policy involved the destruction of homesteads, burning of foodstuffs and crops and the slaughtering of livestock. Boer women and children were then sent concentration camps [@Fourie2014]. These soon became notorious, as insanitary conditions, poor rations and overcrowding led to major epidemics and high mortality rates. Thousands of displaced Africans, too, were rounded up and put into segregated concentration camps, many of which also served as labour depots for the British army [@Marks2011]. 

By 1902 the Republics had been ground down by the large resources of the British army, the destruction of farms, the high death rates among women and children in the concentration camps, and the increasingly tight British control of the countryside through blockhouses and barbed wire [@Marks2011]. The Boer leadership was forced to sue for peace, and on 31 May 1902 the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging was signed [@Pretorius1998]. At the signing of the peace the British Government promised £3million towards rehabilitating the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

Estimates of the mortality rates vary, but it is estimated that at least 22,000 British and 7,000 Boer soldiers died. More than 27,000 Boer women and children died in the concentration camps (out of the 118,000 inmates). An estimated 12,000 black South Africans, who fought in large numbers on both sides, lost their lives, although these estimates are less precise [@Fourie2014]. Recent estimates suggest that African camp mortality rates may have been even higher than in the Boer camps [@Marks2011].

For the purposes of movements in commodity prices, two factors were especially important over this period. From the demand side, the war involved a massive influx of British troops. In 1897, there was at most 10,000 British troops within the Cape Colony [@Evans2000]. By 1900, the British had shipped in massive reinforcements for a counteroffensive against the Republics. By the end of the war, almost 450,000 British regulars and colonial forces had been involved in the war (although all were not necessarily present at any given time), compared to an estimated 88,000 Boer and volunteer forces [@Fourie2014]. The size of the invading army was as large as the combined white citizenry of the Republics [@Marks2011].

From the supply side, the scorched earth policy led to the systematic devastation of the Republics [@Pretorius1998]. The policy started as specific reprisals for Boer attacks, whereby farms in the vicinity of attacks would be burnt. In September 1900 the policy was intensified, to comprise the destruction of all farms and food supplies within 16km of an incident, or if a farm had been used as a commando base. In December 1900, the land clearance policy was intensified to deny support to Boers in the field. Over the course of the war some 30,000 houses, including farms, were burned down or extensively damaged [@Evans2000]. The policy involved the destruction of all food supplies, with fields of grain and maize burned and livestock was killed in enormous numbers. The devastation in the two Republics led to subsequent food shortages [@Pretorius1998]. 

Table 4.1 reports the 1891, 1904 and 1911 census production numbers for 5 commodities in the Cape Colony. Although the scorched earth policy caused the destruction of crops and livestock mostly in the interior of the country, it is still visible in the census numbers for the Cape Colony in 1904, two years after the war. @DeKock1924 showed that the substantial decreases in livestock were visible in the official statistics for all four of the regions during the war. Cattle herds were depleted to such an extent that for years, large quantities of frozen meat had to be imported to satisfy the local demand. The war depleted more than half of the stock of horses in South Africa and reduced the number of woollen sheep significantly, causing a great setback in the wool industry [@Fourie2014].

Moreover, trade between the territories had all but collapsed with the outbreak of the war. According to the Report on the Customs Transactions of the Colony for 1899 (in the Blue Books) the war paralysed trade between the Cape Colony and the two Boer Republics and was seriously interfering with trade with the northern districts of the Cape Colony. Indeed, all trade was suspended between the Cape Colony and the Boer Republics on the 12th October 1899, and a Proclamation (No. 277) was issued, prohibiting such trade. 

One would expect these developments to lead to an increase in agricultural commodity prices around the war period. The two new datasets provide a way of investigating if these developments in demand and supply were reflected in the commodity prices. The following section briefly discusses the history of the monetary and banking system over the period.

###Long-run drivers of prices: Money and Banking
The development of a more modern monetary and banking system, and the corresponding crises, point to the rise of a more modern capitalistic economy in the Cape Colony during this period, and the beginning of business cycles in the modern sense [@Schumann1938]. The development of the monetary and banking system closely influenced the nature of the business cycle. @Schumann1938 argued that the banks were instrumental in intensifying the expansionary phases. 

Figure 4.5 illustrates the measures of the M1 money supply reported in @Verhoef2014, calculated as currency (coins and paper money in circulation) plus deposits (private bank fixed deposits). The movements in the money supply were naturally related to the developments in the monetary and banking system over the period. According to this rough measure, there were large changes in the money supply over the period, reflecting the episodes of instability in the monetary and banking system. The most important of these were the banking crisis of 1889-90, the smaller crisis of 1895-96, and the war period around 1899-1904.

@Friedman1963 discusses three major channels through which any change in the stock of money occurs. The first channel is high-powered money, which is the total of currency held by the public plus bank reserves. An increase in high-powered money leads to an equal percentage increase in the money supply. High-powered money in this case was constrained by the international gold standard. The amount of high-powered money changes through imports and exports of specie in order to produce a balance with other countries on the same standard [@Friedman1963]. Gold generally flowed into the country through large capital investments in the mines. Banking in South Africa developed rapidly under the stimulus of the mining industry during the period [@DeKock1924].  

The second channel is the ratio of commercial bank deposits to reserves. For a given amount of reserves, the higher this ratio the larger the amount of deposits outstanding and the larger the money supply. The ratio of deposits to reserves depends on the willingness of the banks to create deposits relative to their reserves, on regulations, and on the amount of high-powered money available. The third channel is the ratio of commercial bank deposits to currency held by the public. The higher this ratio, the larger the portion of high-powered money that is used as bank reserves, and the larger the money supply. The ratio of deposits to currency is determined by the public, government (legal conditions under which currency and deposits may be issued) and the banks (services and interest offered to depositors) [@Friedman1963].

The rapid advance in currency and bank deposits in 1886-1889, followed by the exceptional decrease in 1890-1892, reflects the overextension and drastic contraction of credit before and after the banking crisis of 1889-90. The speculative boom had resulted from the opening of the gold mines, which led to this overexpansion of credit and inflation of currency [@Schumann1938]. One would expect these investments to lead to an increase in bank deposits and currency imports. Between 1887 and 1889, more than £4 million in specie was imported, nearly two-thirds of the total capital of the gold mines [@Gilbert1933].

During the crisis most of the District Banks in the Cape got into financial difficulties. There were hardly any restrictions on banks and their note issues. In the aftermath of the crisis, 7 of the 8 District Banks were liquidated or amalgamated into the three Imperial Banks: Standard Bank, African Banking Corporation, and the Bank of Africa [@DeKock1924]. In this way the banking business of the Cape Colony was concentrated, with the exception of the Stellenbosch District Bank, in the hands of the three Imperial banks. The Colonial Banking Act was passed in 1891 to prevent similar banking crises and, at the same time, to secure a market for Government stock. According to the Act the banks were to deposit government securities with the Treasury to the full amount of their note issue, the notes being legal tender and redeemable in gold. The total sum issued was limited to the amount of paid-up capital and reserve [@DeKock1924].

After the banking crisis of 1889-90 there was again a period of considerable inflow of capital from abroad there were large investments in the gold mining industry. A substantial proportion was directed through the banks in the Cape Colony and in 1895 over £5 million in specie was imported. This was followed by a similar, albeit less severe, crisis in the latter part of 1895, during which large losses were sustained on gold shares [@Gilbert1933]. 

There was an exceptional increase in both deposits and loans during the war period, especially in the Cape Colony, as well as vast specie imports [@Schumann1938]. The British Government required local labour and supplies to support their troops. Capital and merchandise imports continued for two years after the war, partly from borrowing for reconstruction and partly from the resumption of mining activities. There was a sharp decrease in the money supply after 1903, as accumulating debt service came to exceed new capital. The result was a large outflow of specie after 1903 [@Gilbert1933]. 

Imports of coin again occurred around 1906, but this was curtailed by the local and international recession in 1907 [@Gilbert1933]. The branch-banking system was firmly established and the concentration of banking resources was even carried a step further after the establishment of the Union in 1910 [@Schumann1938]. According to @DeKock1924, banking activities developed rapidly from 1910 to 1914, with large imports of coinage. 

Taking the period as a whole, the country was usually an importer of specie. @Gilbert1933 argued that the more frequent export surplus before 1900 could be explained by the large invisible debits, which were partly met with new capital. After 1905, the rapid growth of debt service and other invisible imports decreased merchandise imports and produced an export surplus that lasted until WWI.

Overall, this was a period of rapid expansion of the commercial banking system. During this period the Imperial banks opened a large number of new branches, not only in the Cape Colony, but throughout South Africa. Table 4.2 reports the banking statistics for all the banks in South Africa (in £'000s). Reserves and Coin and Bullion peaked in 1902, towards the end of the war. @Gilbert1933 provides some rough evidence on the timing of capital inflows, by looking at capital applications in London from South African mines, new railroad miles completed annually, and imports of machinery into the Cape Colony. These measures reflect the cyclical movements in capital imports, with peaks between 1902 and 1904.

According to Table 4.2, the ratio of deposits to reserves reached a peak in 1902 and declined towards 1907. The rise in the deposit-reserve ratio reflect the rise and maturation of the Imperial banks, which found it profitable to operate with a lower reserves relative to deposits. The ratio of deposits to currency increased throughout the period.  At the outset, the public held £2.75 of deposits for each pound of currency. This increased to almost £5.5 by 1910. The low initial value probably helped to produce and intensify the banking crisis of 1889-90. In general, banking difficulties are followed by a decrease in the ratio of deposits to currency, as the public seeks to convert the one into the other [@Friedman1963]. The rise in the ratio thereafter probably reflected the spread of the branch-banking system, the more widespread availability of checking facilitates, and the greater usefulness of bank deposits. Another important factor was probably the growing real income per capita over the period [@DeZwart2011].

One would expect overall price inflation to reflect these developments in the money supply. In order to gauge the validity of the total wholesale price index, it is compared to these trends in the money supply. The following section briefly discusses the history of railway development and market integration in the Cape Colony as another potential driver of prices. 

###Long-run drivers of prices: Market Integration
For most of the 19th century transport between towns in South Africa was basic and expensive, due to the large distances between towns and the rugged terrain between the coast and the interior. The ox wagon was the main form of freight transport between towns [@Fourie2015]. 

The mineral revolution created an urgent need for an efficient means of transportation of goods and passengers between the coastal ports and the mining towns in the interior. The result was a rapid expansion of the railway network and a decline in transportation costs [@DeKock1924]. The railway line from Cape Town to Kimberley was completed in 1885. In 1892, railway lines from Kimberley to Port Elizabeth, the port on the Eastern Cape coast, and to the gold mines of Johannesburg were completed. The railway network was used to transport diamonds and gold to the coast, as well as transporting produce, provisions and the large mining machinery to the growing towns in the interior [@Fourie2015]. The completion of these main railway lines between the coastal towns and the mining towns served to integrate transaction flows in an unprecedented way [@Greyling2015]. 

Prior to the war the Cape Government had been concerned mainly with the construction of main lines and the development of main line traffic. The Cape Colony's railway network initially consisted of three main lines connecting the ports of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London with the diamond producing region in Kimberley. Access was limited to towns through which the main railway lines passed. Towns further from the main lines had to rely on transport riders that were expensive over long distances [@Fourie2015a]. 

In the meantime, a number of private companies had been established, under concession and subsidy from Parliament, for the purpose of building branch lines. For example, in 1883 the Cape Central Railway was authorised as a subsidised line by an Act of Parliament. The first section of the line, from Worcester to Ashton, was opened for traffic in 1887, and subsequently from Ashton to Swellendam in 1897. It was not until 1906 that the line was extended as far as Mossel Bay [@DeKock1924]. 

Another period of rapid expansion of the railway lines occurred just after the war. Investment focused on branch lines to act as feeders to the main lines or as connections between them (e.g. the route between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth) [@Fourie2015]. A number of branch and subsidiary main lines were built to develop the agricultural prospects of the Colony [@Schumann1938]. Between 1902 and 1910, 1,194 miles of new railway lines were opened by the Cape Government, compared to 244 miles during the previous nine years from 1892 to 1901 [@DeKock1924].

Figure 4.6 illustrates the development of the railways in South Africa. The dates indicate the opening of the railway line at each town (underlined dates indicate the start of construction). The thicker lines denote railway lines completed before 1902, while the thinner lines denote lines completed after 1902.

@Fourie2015a found that the development of the railway made a large contribution to economic growth in the Cape Colony. According to their estimates, 46%-51% of the growth in labour productivity in the Cape Colony between 1873 and 1905 derived directly from the railway. 

Presumably, internal or regional market integration was also aided by the development of the railways around the turn of the 20th century. Theory suggests that integrated markets generate important economic benefits. A comparative advantage effect may result from greater regional specialisation, economies of scale, increased investment opportunities, and greater incentives for technical progress and innovation [@Andrabi2010].

![Development of the railways in South Africa](Railways.png)

Cournot characterised an integrated market as "*an entire territory of which the parts are so united by the relations of unrestricted commerce that prices take the same level throughout with ease and rapidity.*" Market integration is therefore a twofold process. Firstly, equilibrium price levels must be equal, and secondly, prices must return quickly to this level after a shock [@Federico2012]. 

The first dimension concerns the convergence of prices for the same goods are throughout the economy. Market integration along this dimension features a decline in price gaps or price dispersion. Decreasing transportation costs should lead to lower price dispersion and more integrated markets [@Andrabi2010]. The second dimension concerns the efficiency with which price gaps return to equilibrium after a shock. This reflects growing market efficiency, especially through better circulation of information about prices and fundamentals [@Federico2013]. These two conditions are tested different techniques. Trends in price gaps or dispersion are tested by looking at pairwise trends in relative prices or, for a large number of markets, by trends in the coefficient of variation. Tess of efficiency typically involve time-series comovement and cointegration methods [@Federico2013]. High-frequency data can aid the investigation along both dimensions [@Ejrnæs2008].

Overall the international literature seems to show that railway development was one of the main causes of the substantial convergence in commodity prices in several economies in the late 1800s and early 1900s [@Andrabi2010]. Railways improved the integration of markets in many regions, including Europe [@Federico2012], the US [@Federico2013] and India [@Donaldson2012]. @Andrabi2010, however, showed that not all integration was necessarily a consequence of railway development and that commodity prices in India were converging almost as rapidly between districts without railways as with railways.

To date there has been little research on regional market integration in the Cape Colony around the turn of the 20th century, which was presumably aided by the development of the railways. @Boshoff2017 showed that product markets in the Cape Colony were fairly well integrated by the turn of the century. They found that Western Cape agricultural markets were quite well integrated internally, as evidenced by the significant correlations between prices in Malmesbury, Clanwilliam, Worcester and Cape Town. The wheat and maize markets of major towns located on the main railway lines were integrated with those of Cape Town, particularly those of Beaufort West and Colesberg and the key market of Kimberley. They also found that Eastern Cape wheat and maize markets were on the whole less well integrated with Cape Town markets, although the towns with good railway links, such as Aliwal North, Cradock, Dordrecht and King William's Town, did have significant connections with the market in Cape Town. They estimated a long-term equilibrium relationship, using the bounds test method suggested by @Pesaran2001. The results confirmed that Eastern Cape wheat markets were not integrated with Cape Town's but that there was a long-term relationship between Kimberley's wheat and maize prices and those of Cape Town.

The study of market integration was complicated by limited data availability. For instance, the correlations were only based on monthly data for the period 1897-1906 for just 4 products, while the bounds tests could only be applied to the prices from 5 towns. Moreover, the analysis of correlations and cointegrating relationships test only the second dimension of market integration, i.e. efficiency in the parlance of @Federico2012. Part of this chapter builds on the work of @Boshoff2017, by also addressing the first dimension of market integration, i.e. convergence, and expanding the period and set of products analysed in the second dimension. 

###Summary
Overall, the turn of the 20th century was a turbulent period of South African history. Globalisation and the discovery of minerals transformed the Cape Colony into a prosperous exporting region with an increasing GDP [@Fourie2015a]. Over this period, therefore, the Cape Colony is an interesting example of a developing capitalistic economy, where internationalisation and internal market integration was just beginning to take hold [@Boshoff2017]. 

The primary aim of the chapter is to demonstrate aggregation methods to calculate a high-frequency (i.e. monthly) commodity prices index from 1889 to 1914, using incomplete historical records. The chapter develops monthly wholesale commodity price indices for a number of individual products, as well as an overall wholesale commodity price index. The individual price indices are intended to shed light on the demand and supply factors that influenced product prices. The more comprehensive wholesale price index is intended to provide a clearer picture of the inflation history of the period. The secondary objective is to use the high-frequency price data to investigate internal market integration in the Cape Colony, during this period of rapid development of the railway network. The chapter addresses the first dimension of market integration, while expanding the period and the number of products along the second dimension. The following section introduces the two datasets used in the chapter. 

##Data: Wholesale Commodity Prices
The primary aim of the chapter is to demonstrate aggregation methods to estimate monthly historical wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony between 1889 and 1914. The wholesale commodity price indices presented below are based on two new datasets on market prices[^34] that have been digitised and transcribed.

[^34]: All prices were reported in pounds sterling (£), shillings (s) and pennies (d) and converted to pennies. There were 20 shillings (s) in a pound (£), and 12 pennies (d) in a shilling (s).  

The first dataset is an expanded version of the monthly prices used in @Boshoff2017. It reports the monthly "*Current Market Rates (Wholesale) of Agricultural Produce*", as telegraphed by the Civil Commissioners and reported in the Agricultural Journals of the Department of Agriculture of the Cape Colony. The Journals are available from October 1889 to August 1914, which dictates the period that the indices cover. Monthly data are available for 24 different commodities (e.g. wheat, eggs and tobacco)[^35] in 19 towns across the Cape Colony (e.g. Cape Town, Kimberley and Port Elizabeth).[^36] 

[^35]: The 24 products are wheat, wheat flour, boer meal, mealies, mealie meal, barley, oats, oathay, lucerne hay, potatoes, tobacco (boer roll), beef, mutton, fresh butter, eggs, cattle (slaughter), sheep (slaughter), pigs (slaughter), bread, oranges, saddle-horses, transport oxen, milch cows, woolled sheep.
	
[^36]: The 19 Cape Colony towns are: Aliwal North, Beaufort West, Burghersdorp, Cape Town, Clanwilliam, Cradock, Dordrecht, East London, Graaff-Reinet, Graham's Town, Kimberley, King William's Town, Malmesbury, Mossel Bay, Port Alfred, Port Elizabeth, Queen's Town, Tarkastad, and Worcester. The data also includes a few prices for towns in the other territories (e.g. Johannesburg) in the final few months of the sample. Unfortunately, these are too few to include in the indices.

Figure 4.7 illustrates the number of monthly observations by commodity. Clearly the sample suffers from missing data points. The Journal volumes do not record prices for all of the towns for all of the products over the sample period, and for some months no prices were recorded. The increase in observations around the turn of the century is due to the fact that weekly prices were recorded over that period.

The second dataset reports annual market prices in the Colonial Blue Books of the Cape Colony, available from 1889 to 1907. The annual market prices in Colonial Blue Books were collected by the colonial administrators in South Africa and sent to the Colonial Office in London [@DeZwart2011]. This information on "Average Market Prices of Agricultural Produce,"[^37] "Provisions,"[^38] and "Stock and Animal Productions"[^39] were used to create a database that includes prices of 50 agricultural products in 48 towns.[^40] The annual data is also incomplete in terms of the coverage of products and towns. In a few cases there were more than one series for a specific commodity, such as three different series for wine (ordinary quality, better quality and wine without a description) and two series for beer (English and Colonial). The annual data for the Provisions possibly reflect average retail prices, rather than the wholesale prices of the other series [@DeZwart2011]. This chapter follows @Klovland2013 in including these prices rather than leaving large gaps in the series. One would expect the retail prices to follow a similar trend to the wholesale prices.

}
rsblue$lnprice <- log(rsblue$price)
rsblue <- transform(rsblue, id = as.numeric(interaction(factor(town),factor(commodity),drop=TRUE)))
```

In some cases the commodity and town series in the two datasets overlap, although they are almost always reported in different units. For instance, in the monthly dataset wheat prices are reported in pounds (lbs), whereas in the annual data the wheat prices are reported per bushel. This means that the trends can be compared, even though the levels are different. For the most part the average prices reported in the two datasets seem to capture a similar trend over time, as one would expect. 

The challenge is to combine and aggregate these two sets of prices in a consistent way in order to create coherent price indices of agricultural commodities for the Cape Colony. This is complicated by the fact that there are so many missing values in both datasets. The following section presents the methodology suggested to tackle these challenges.

##Methodology
###Price indices
Higher-frequency price indices are useful in studying inflation, business cycles, and market behaviour in general. The first generation of price indices, such as @Jevons1865 and @Giffen1879, focused on the effect of the gold supply on the general price level. @Gilbert1933 followed this tradition in his analysis of the economic effects of gold discoveries on South Africa, using the annual weighted aggregated index of the prices of 13 foods for 1883-1907 reported above. Another strand of the literature, which includes @Persons1921 and @Silberling1923, focused on the measurement of business cycles or "*business conditions during alternating periods of prosperity and depression.*" The seminal work of @Schumann1938 on business cycles in South Africa follows this tradition. He used a quarterly wholesale price index from 1910-1936 in this analysis. 

This chapter uses two datasets of market prices to construct monthly historical wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony from 1889 to 1914. The brief review of the data sources showed that the price series were extracted from publications that were incomplete and in some cases just missing. This is a common occurrence, as many historical price series are obtained from publications that are incomplete or in some cases no longer available. Even when the publications are available on a continual basis there may be cases when a particular data series contains substantial gaps or was discontinued. The supply of agricultural commodities may vary according to seasonal factors and occasional crop failures, creating gaps in the price series. Coverage may deteriorate during periods of conflict or war. Quality descriptions and publication practices may also change over time. These problems make it challenging to combine price data to form continuous time series [@Klovland2014a].

The problem becomes concrete in the simple inflation calculation used below to gauge the internal validity of the indices. When inflation is calculated as simple period-on-period growth rates, every missing price observation leads to three missing inflation observations. In these historical records, every commodity price series fir a particular town contains many missing observations. In some cases there are long periods where no prices were recorded. A continuous series would require substantial interpolation and in some cases substantial extrapolation, which would assume constant prices in those periods. Although more sophisticated time series methods may be implemented (e.g. AR models), they would still amount to interpolation and extrapolation, in some cases over long periods. 

The traditional procedure for dealing with the problem of gaps in historical data is to splice the series when there is overlapping information (see for instance @Solar2011). This method involves considerable work and requires great care. If there are many time series and various gaps in the data, as is often the case with higher frequency historical data, this procedure may become difficult to implement consistently [@Klovland2014a]. The repeat sales example in the Appendix shows that in some cases this method may become quite subjective. In practice, with many time series, such procedures would be very difficult and time consuming to implement consistently.

@Klovland2014a recommended that the repeat sales method could be useful whenever underlying series were characterised by incomplete observations. The repeat sales method was specifically developed for markets in which the price an item is recorded infrequently and at irregular intervals, which is typical in the real estate market. The problems in aggregating the high-frequency historical data are similar in principle, although the gaps between the observed observations are usually shorter. The repeat sales approach compares the price of that same item over time, with a sale occurring whenever a data point is observed. One can think of each commodity price series (for a particular product description) in each town as a specific item (e.g. a property or an artwork) to follow over time. 

###Repeat Sales Method
@Bailey1963 initially proposed the repeat sales method to calculate house price changes. Their procedure was a generalisation of the chained matched model method previously used to construct real estate price indices. The method was subsequently extended by @Case1987, among others, and is currently used to produce the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices in the US.

As discussed in chapter 2, the repeat sales method tracks the sale of the same item over time. It aggregates sales pairs and estimates the average return on the set of items in each period [@Kraussl2010]. The index is derived from a regression involving a set of time dummy variables. It requires information only on the rate of change in each price series and the dates when the prices were recorded [@Klovland2014a].

Following @Wang1997, the model underlying the method in @Bailey1963 may be derived in the following manner. Where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the times of the first and second transactions, a price relative $\frac{P_{i,t_2}}{P_{i,t_1}}$ can be modelled as:
$$\frac{P_{i,t_2}}{P_{i,t_1}} = \frac{I_{t_2}}{I_{t_1}} \times u_{i,t} , $$
where $P_{it}$ is the price of commodity $i$ at time $t$; $I_t$ is the true but unknown index for period $t$; and $u_{i,t}$ is the error term. Taking logs,
$$\ln \frac{P_{i,t_2}}{P_{i,t_1}} = -\ln(I_{t_1}) + \ln(I_{t_2}) + \ln(u_{i,t})$$

This relationship can be expressed in vector notation as $y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $y$ is the vector of logged price relatives; $\beta$ is a T-dimensional column vector of unknown logarithms of the index numbers to be estimated, such that the $t$-th component of the $\beta$ vector is $\beta_t = \ln(I_t)$; X is a matrix of $(n \times T)$ dimensions such that the $t$-th component of each row is -1 if $t=t_1$, +1 if $t=t_2$, and 0 otherwise; and $\epsilon$ is the vector of $\log(u_{i,t})$ values. 

The repeat sales model may also be derived as the first differences of a hedonic model, yielding the same regression model. The standard specification of the repeat sales method usually takes the following form:
$$\ln \frac{P_{it}}{P_{is}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \beta_t D_{it} + u_{it}$$
where $P_{it}$ is the price of a specific commodity $i$ (e.g. wheat in Cape Town) in time $t$; $P_{is}$ is the price of the same commodity $i$ at time $s$; $\beta_t$ is the parameter to be estimated for time $t$; $D_{it}$ represents a time dummy equal to 1 in period $t$ when the resale occurred, -1 in period $s$ when the previous sale occurred, and 0 otherwise; and $u_{it}$ is a white noise residual. 

Thus, in the standard repeat sales model the dependent variable is regressed on a set of dummy variables reflecting time periods. The coefficients are estimated on the basis of changes in item prices over time. The index numbers are derived from the dummy variable coefficients. The price index is simply the antilog of the series of estimated coefficients: $\hat{\beta_1}, ..., \hat{\beta_T}$. 

At each time $t$ there exists a distribution of growth rates in the sample. The repeat sales estimator is a measure of the central tendency of this distribution, in the form of the geometric mean of the growth rates of the items that sold more than once.[^41]  @Bailey1963 showed that the $\beta$ estimates (i.e. the mean logged price indices) consist of the period-by-period weighted averages of the logged price relatives, with weights proportional to the sample sizes. In other words, the regression solutions are complicated weighted averages of the average logged price relatives. @Wang1997 showed this clearly for a relatively simple and intuitively appealing example with two periods. For example, the first index value in $t_1$ is the weighted average of two quantities: the average logged appreciation of items observed in period $t_0$ and $t_1$; and the average appreciation from $t_0$ to $t_2$ minus the average appreciation from $t_1$ to $t_2$. The weights given to the two quantities are proportional to their sample sizes.

[^41]: Such an index will track the geometric mean, rather than the arithmetic mean, of prices over time, because of the log transformation prior to estimation. If it is assumed that the regression residuals are normally distributed in each period, a correction can be made by defining corrected index values as: $I_t =\exp\left[\gamma_t+ 1/2(\sigma_t^2-\sigma_0^2 )\right]*100$, where $\sigma_t^2$ is the estimated variance of the residuals in period t (Renneboog & Spaenjers 2012). In practice this adjustment is often negligible (Hansen 2009), which is also the case in this sample.

In this case, the repeat sales method has the advantage of being able to handle gaps of any length in the data series. It utilises all of the information in the dataset, compared to the cumbersome traditional approach of manual splicing of individual price time series [@Klovland2014a]. As @Wang1997 noted, if the number of observations does not vary across time periods (i.e. if there are no gaps in the time series), the repeat sales estimator simplifies to an ordinary chain index.

One would like to observe prices for a static commodity description over time (e.g. English beer per bottle). However, new qualities are often introduced to the market (e.g. Colonial beer per gallon) and old ones disappear. The repeat sales approach can also handle this case by tracking prices for the same product description over time.

The typical disadvantages of the repeat sales method are not real concerns in this case, namely that single-sale data is discarded and that there is sample selection bias in the types of commodities that are sold more than once [@Hansen2009]. In this case, all of the commodities were sold more than once and could be included in the index estimates. Changes in product characteristics are more likely to occur if there are long periods of time between the observations. @Case1987 suggested a weighted three-step least square procedure to attach more weight to recent changes than to changes over long periods of time. This is likely to be less of a problem in this sample, however, because the sales appear so frequently compared to real estate prices which often only resell after decades.  

This approach treats all observations as equal, which means that towns observed more frequently will have a stronger influence on the index, simply because there will be more observations of this item. In other words, the prices for the same commodity in different towns are treated equally and towns with more observations have a higher implicit weighting. This might be a sensible approach, as regularly quoted prices are often the most frequently traded [@Klovland2014a]. It is possible that the smaller towns have more price observations in some periods which do not properly reflect price movements in the larger towns. For instance, there might be an idiosyncratic spike in Worcester wheat prices in a period where only Worcester prices were reported. However, idiosyncratic price movements in specific towns are less likely to bias the overall indices because the estimates include a large number of towns from two separate datasets. 

The repeat sales method therefore provides a consistent way to aggregate the data from the different towns for a specific commodity. Price series from a number of towns help to make the index continuous by adding observations where individual series suffered from missing observations. Thus, including more price series will lead to fewer gaps in the index. Even if the prices are at different levels due to factors such as transport costs, for the purposes of the index the growth rates are compared over time. This method therefore generates an index with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series, without the need for substantial interpolation or extrapolation. 

###Creating indices for specific commodities
@Klovland2014a suggested that the simple unweighted version of the repeat sales model is most applicable for specific commodities, i.e. at the lowest level of aggregation, when explicit weighting of different price observations is less crucial. The towns are weighted implicitly according to coverage, i.e. the number of observations in each dataset. Following this suggestion, the repeat sales method is used to aggregate the different time series for each commodity from the all the towns in the Cape Colony. A simple example is presented in the Appendix to illustrate the procedure.

The annual prices from the Blue Books can be used to supplement the results from the monthly data from the Agricultural Journals. This is useful because the monthly commodity indices still contain substantial gaps where no data is available. It is also useful because the monthly dataset omits a number of important products and towns. Wool is one example of an important export product in the Cape Colony, which is not present in the monthly dataset. 

The challenge then is to incorporate the lower-frequency (i.e. annual) index into a higher-frequency (i.e. monthly) index. The Blue Books data reports the annual market prices as average prices for November of each year. The simplest way to incorporate the annual prices is to set them as the November prices for each year, and then to simply add them to the monthly dataset. The repeat sales method is then applied to the monthly and annual prices together, to obtain a more complete index for each commodity. 

Figure 4.9 illustrates the index for wheat prices in the Cape Colony, as well as two indices estimated separately from the two datasets for comparison.[^42] For the separate indices, the monthly wheat prices for 20 towns in the Cape Colony are combined to form a monthly wheat index, while the annual wheat prices for the 48 towns are combined to form an annual wheat price index. The total index combines the prices from both datasets and seems to reflect both of the separate indices closely. The repeat sales method allows for the estimation of an index with more complete coverage, although there are still a few gaps for the months when no price information was recorded. The index may be interpolated at this stage to obtain a complete index. This involves significantly less interpolation than would have been necessary if each individual series was interpolated from the start.

[^42]: As a robustness check, the repeat sales method was also estimated on the two datasets separately, to obtain two indices for each commodity, one monthly and one annual. After interpolating the annual index, the two monthly indices for each commodity were then be combined again with the repeat sales method to obtain one reasonably continuous index for each commodity which covers all the towns in the Cape Colony. With this method, the indices from the two data sources implicitly receive an equal weighting. The results were very similar to the results reported below.

###Aggregation of commodity indices
The construction of the indices involve three stages of aggregation. The first stage involves aggregating the price information from the various towns from the two sources into indices for 43 individual commodities. This is accomplished by using the repeat sales method described above. It involves combining the individual data series on each commodity in an efficient way to form an index, using all available price information. For many commodities there are prices from both sources, as well as prices for different product qualities (e.g. Colonial and English Beer, or high and ordinary quality wine). This stage involves only an implicit weighting, where the towns with the greatest number of observations are the most influential in determining the coefficient estimates [@Klovland2014a].

The next stage involves the aggregation of the individual commodity price indices into 7 broader commodity group indices, which are weighted together in the conventional manner, such as the Laspeyres price index. For instance, @Klovland2014a aggregated his 110 commodities into 16 commodity groups (grain, meat, etc.) using chained Laspeyres indices, with weights based on output or trade values in 1835, 1870, 1890 and 1910. This raises the question of what weights to use to aggregate the different commodities. The Agricultural Journals, particularly in the earlier volumes, refer to these prices as "wholesale" rates. "Wholesale prices" typically refer to sales in large lots, often the first commercial transaction in major trading centres [@Klovland2014a]. The first price indices were often called wholesale price indices and typically included both imported and domestically produced goods, although weights were not always applied consistently. Nowadays producer price indices (PPIs) are more popular. PPIs focus on prices obtained by domestic producers, and therefore include domestic goods sold at home, and in some cases exported goods [@Klovland2014a]. 

In this case the focus is on domestic production shares. The produce returns reported in the 1904 census are used as the benchmark weights. The value shares were calculated as the average market price multiplied by the volume of production of each commodity. The difficulty is that the census did not cover all of the commodities in the sample and a number of important products lack weights, e.g. wheat flour and beef. The weights for these products were based on import values reported in the Blue Books. This approach follows @Greyling2015, where agricultural output was based on the volume of production reported in the censuses, and also supplemented with information on export and import values. Thus, the different commodity indices for the Cape Colony are aggregated by applying weights based on the value shares of each commodity in domestic production, and supplemented by import value weights. This weighting scheme makes the indices akin to the wholesale price index used in @Klovland2014a.

The individual commodities included in each of the 7 commodity group indices are reported in Table 4.3. The categorisation is informed by the classification of the commodities in the data sources. For instance, in the Blue Books, the prices are divided into Agricultural Produce, Stock and Animal Productions, and Provisions.[^43] 

[^43]: A few commodities had to be excluded from the analysis because of a lack of observations. These include lucerne hay and oranges from the Agricultural Journals, as well pumpkins, aloes, argol, condensed milk and lamp oil from the Blue Books.

print(xt, "latex", include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE, 
      caption.placement = getOption("xtable.caption.placement", "top"), scalebox = 0.7)
```

The weights are only required to be relative value shares, i.e. weights relative to the other commodities in the larger commodity groups, which makes it easier to compare the commodities in each group. For instance, the livestock production numbers from the census may be compared to each other to form the livestock index. However, only a portion of livestock produced would be sold in any given period, which makes it difficult to compare these numbers to the other commodities, e.g. the gallons of milk. This is also the reason that the commodities in the indices for provisions are kept apart from the other commodities. For example, wheat (Crops) and wheat flour (Agricultural Provisions) are included in separate commodity group indices, because the weighting for Crops are based on production value shares from the 1904 census, whereas the weighting for Agricultural Provisions is based on import value shares.

The few gaps remaining in the individual commodity price indices are interpolated at this stage to form continuous series. The interpolation that occurs at this stage is much less substantial than would be the case if all of the individual price series were interpolated from the start. A number of products were only reported in the Blue Books, so the indices only report values for November of each year. Similar to @Klovland2013, these indices are also interpolated to form monthly indices, which makes them smoother than the actual monthly price would have been. The series are seasonally adjusted and the weighted average of the price relatives are calculated, as recommended by the @IMF2004 for the construction of the PPI.

The final stage then combines the 7 indices for the commodity groups to form an overall aggregate wholesale price index. The difficulty is that the weights are not all comparable, given that some of the commodity groups are weighted with reference to production values in the 1904 census, while the three provision indices are weighted with reference to import values. There will always be some difficulties in finding the best weights with historical data. Different authors have used different assumptions to create relative value shares. @Klovland2013, for instance, estimated the relative weights for each commodity within the group as follows: The commodity with the greatest market value was given a weight of 10 and the other commodities were scaled proportionately, using rounded weights, subject to the constraint that all the time series for which data was available would receive a weight of at least one. 

In order to combine the 7 commodity groups into an overall wholesale index, a similar assumption is made about the relative weights of the commodity groups. The following weights are based on the available information on production and import value shares: Crops (5), Agricultural Produce (5), Pastoral Products (3), Livestock (5), Pastoral Provisions (5), Agricultural Provisions (3), and Other Provisions (3). The intention is merely to use reasonable weights to aggregate indices [@Klovland2014a].[^44] 

[^44]: Klovland (2014b) makes to further points. Firstly, if a raw material is used in the production of a more finished commodity, some reduction in the weights based on gross output measures may be necessary. Secondly, a large portion of agricultural products may have been consumed on the farms, rather than sold on the market. In practice, it is difficult to find evidence of how large these adjustments should be.

The following section presents the results for the wholesale price indices, for each level of aggregation. In order to gauge the validity of the price indices, and to test their conformity to the existing measures of the price level, they are compared to trends in local and international prices and to developments in the money supply. The subsequent sections then present the results of two applications using the underlying data and the price indices. The first is the study of pricing dynamics, by looking at the size and frequency of price changes. This information is then used to calculate an alternative measure of inflation, which can be decomposed into a flexible and sticky inflation components, and provides an internal validity test of the price indices. The second is the study of internal market integration in the Cape Colony, by examining both dimensions of market integration.

##Results: Wholesale Price Indices
This section presents the results for the wholesale price indices at each level of aggregation. The individual price indices are intended to shed light on the demand and supply factors that influenced product prices. The more comprehensive wholesale price index is intended to provide a clearer picture of the inflation history of the period. The following sections check the conformity of the indices with the historical record, by comparing the indices to existing measures of prices, as well as the money supply. 

###Wholesale Price Indices
Figure 4.10 illustrates the seasonally adjusted commodity price indices for 4 individual commodities: wheat, tobacco, cattle and beef. There was a large variation in price movements when comparing individual commodity prices. The wheat price index decreased significantly after the recessionary period of the early 1890s. The index reached a trough in May 1895 and subsequently recovered during the upswing phase up to mid-1888. Subsequently, wheat prices were on a general downward trajectory, with two exceptions during the war (early 1901) and the post-war recovery (mid-1903). Wheat prices reached a trough in November 1911, before recovering somewhat towards the end of the sample period.

In contrast, the tobacco price index remained relatively stable up until the outbreak of the war, before increasing substantially during the war period, from October 1899 to May 1901. Tobacco prices returned to pre-war levels during the post-war recession. @DeKock1924 reports that there was abnormal demand for products like tobacco and wine during the war, followed by a substantial decline in prices during the subsequent recession.

The indices for cattle and beef follow similar paths, which is reassuring for such closely related products (cattle prices were derived from separate series for cattle, transport oxen and *milch* cows). Both price indices increased significantly in the run-up to the war, with subsequent peaks in the post-war recovery period from 1902 to around 1906. Cattle prices exhibited some spikes during the war in the middle of 1900 and during the post-war recovery phases. There was a relatively sharp decrease into the recession in 1907, and the subsequent cycle peaked towards the end of 1911. The effect of the rinderpest outbreak in 1896 is barely visible, probably because cattle herd losses were centred on the Transvaal, Natal, the Orange Free State and the eastern districts of the Cape, as opposed to the entire Cape Colony [@DeKock1924].

Beef prices increased significantly in the run-up to the war, with a large peak in 1903 during the recovery phase. This was followed by a significant decrease during the post-war recessionary period, and a mild recovery towards the end of the period. @DeKock1924 reports that large quantities of frozen meat had to be imported for years after the war to satisfy the local requirements.

The indices for the commodity groups are illustrated in Figures 4.11 and 4.12. Figure 4.13 illustrates the total wholesale price index, with recessionary periods shaded. The trend in the wholesale commodity price indices conforms to the literature on the economic history of the Cape Colony. Commodity prices decreased during the recessionary periods of 1891-1893 and 1894-95, and increased during the upswing phase from 1895. Prices decreased briefly in 1897, reflecting the recession that @Schumann1938 identified in that year. Virtually all of the indices increased markedly during the war, with the total wholesale index reaching a peak in 1901. The exception is the general decline in the index for "Other Provisions" (e.g. tea and coffee). Prices remained at the high level and even increased in some cases during the post-war recovery up to 1903. Most of the price indices decrease markedly during the post-war recession of 1903-1905 and again during the recession of 1907-1910, down to their levels before the war. In most cases prices were stable or increased slightly towards the end of the sample period. 

The price indices therefore exhibited clear cyclical trends over the period, with a large increase before and during the war and a large decrease after the war up to unification. A number of studies have found similar large increases during the war-time periods [e.g. @Schumann1938; @Friedman1952; and @Klovland2014b].  @Schumann1938 described the Second South African War as the predominant cause of the most intense and significant economic fluctuation in the past. It was accompanied by a supply shock, especially for the Boer Republics, as well as a demand shock. From the supply-side, the war led to considerable destruction of crops and livestock in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and to a lesser extent in some parts of the Cape and Natal. Agriculture and stock farming were seriously disrupted in those regions [@DeKock1924].  On the demand side, the war cost Britain about £250 million, which was financed primarily through loans. It is estimated that some $300 million of British government loans were floated in New York market from 1900-1902 [@Friedman1963]. A large proportion was spent in the Cape Colony on agricultural and pastoral produce for the troops, which increased prices and stimulated production [@DeKock1924]. The inflationary episodes in the total wholesale index seem to correspond with the expansions and contractions in the money supply, as discussed in more detail in the following section.

###External Validity and Evaluation: CPI and the Money Supply
In order to gauge the validity of the price indices, and to test their conformity to the existing measures of prices changes, they are compared to other price indices and money supply developments. This section compares the total wholesale price index (WPI) to the two CPIs estimated by @DeZwart2011, as well as the money supply in the Cape Colony over the period. 

As discussed above, @DeZwart2011 calculated CPI based on a "bare bones" and a "respectable" basket of goods for consumption. The two CPIs are only available at an annual frequency, and differ from the estimated WPI in terms of the underlying prices, composition, weighting and construction, which may lead to dissimilar movements in the indices [@Klovland2014a]. Nevertheless, it is of some interest to compare the indices to see whether they provide the same basic picture of inflation trends in the Cape Colony. The caveat in using the WPI as a gauge of inflation is that the products included are primarily agricultural goods and raw materials. As such, they omit some important non-agricultural products and services. Nevertheless, the WPI does include many more products than the CPIs, which are based on the annual prices of 8 and 10 products respectively. 

Figure 4.14 compares the annualised WPI to the bare bones and respectable basket CPIs. Although the price levels seem to be comparable over the period, there is a large deviation between the WPI and the three CPIs, especially around the war period. The CPI based on the respectable consumption basket is the most similar to the WPI in that it includes more products and is derived from similar prices reported in the Blue Books. Although there is a significant positive correlation of 0.56 between the two, reported in Table 4.4, the association is quite weak. The correlation between the new WPI and the bare bones CPI is not significant, which is perhaps to be expected given the differences in the composition, weighting and construction method.

}

g <- g + ylab("Index") + xlab("")

g <- g + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + theme(legend.position="bottom")
g
```

In general the WPI exhibits larger movements than the CPIs. Short-term cycles in WPIs often exhibit more pronounced amplitudes than cycles in CPIs, because the WPI contains a larger share of producer goods (e.g. raw materials), which are often more sensitive to business cycles than consumer goods, due to the inelasticity of agricultural production [@Klovland2014a]. Movements in retail price indices often exhibit a smaller amplitude or a greater stickiness than movements in wholesale price indices, as they contain more constant cost elements, such as costs of distribution and fuel, light and rent [@Schumann1938]. 

The WPI can also be evaluated according to whether they conform to the path implied by available monetary aggregates, in order to gauge if it provides a plausible history of inflation for the Cape Colony over this period. The caveat is that the WPI is not a perfect measure of wholesale prices, let alone a broader measure of the price level, as it places disproportionate emphasis on agricultural products and raw materials.

Figure 4.15 compares the annual WPI to the rough measure of M1 money supply, as well as money supply per unit of output. The money supply per unit of output provides a simple gauge of the implied inflation history, based on the traditional Quantity Theory, given the tenuous assumption that the velocity of money was constant over the period [@Schumann1938; @Friedman1963]. According to @Friedman1952, inflation occurs when the money supply increases more rapidly than output. The WPI seems to follow the developments implied by the movements in the money supply quite closely. 

Table 4.4 reports that the correlation in levels was significant. The correlation in the growth rates between the WPI and money supply per unit of output was only significant at a level of 10%. It should be borne in mind that these are rough measures, and one would not expect a one-to-one relationship, especially over the short-term. Nevertheless, the WPI seems to follow developments in the money supply much more closely than the existing measures of CPI, and may provide a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the inflation history of the period.

###External Validity: International Wholesale Prices
Commodity prices in other countries provide another useful validity check of the new price indices. Commodity prices in Britain, the colonial ruler and the Cape Colony's main trading partner at the time, might be particularly useful. The Statist-Sauerbeck indices for Britain and the Warren-Persons indices for the US, as reported in @Warren1932, are used for the comparison. The currency of the Cape Colony was linked to the British pound throughout the period and the US index is converted to pound sterling.

Figure 4.16 illustrates UK and Cape Colony wheat price indices in the left panel and the wholesale price indices for the UK, US, and Cape Colony in the right panel. Wheat prices appear to be closely linked in the period before the war, with peaks and a trough occurring quite close together. However, there were two peaks in Cape wheat prices during and after the war, which do not appear in the UK series. The series are at similar levels between 1905 and 1910, diverge markedly up to 1913, and then end on a similar levels. Table 4.5 shows that the contemporaneous correlation between the two series is relatively low. These high-frequency comparisons for the entire Cape Colony provide a slightly different and perhaps more nuanced picture than the long-term trends illustrated in @Boshoff2017. They found that Cape Town wheat prices started reflecting UK trends during the 1870s, soon after the mineral discoveries.

grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2, nrow =1)
```

The wholesale price indices follow a similar trend during the first half of the 1890s. The decrease up to the middle of the 1890s conforms to the pattern of prices in many European countries, often referred to as the great deflation [@Klovland2014a]. However, after 1895 there is quite a large divergence between the indices, as the war seems to have affected the course of prices. The Cape WPI increases markedly before and during the war and then decreases dramatically up to Unification. Conversely, the UK and US indices exhibit pronounced cycles along an increasing trend. The contemporaneous correlations, reported in Table 4.5, are not significant. Nevertheless, there are similarities in the timing of price changes, e.g. increases in 1899, 1903, and 1913, and decreases in early 1890s, 1904, and 1907.

```{r table4.5, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
source("corstarsl.R")
xt <- xtable(corstarsl(UK[,c(-1,-5)]), caption="Correlations in Levels")
print(xt, "latex",comment=FALSE, caption.placement = getOption("xtable.caption.placement", "top"))
```

To test this more formally, the turning points in the indices are determined with the Bry-Boschan non-parametric dating algorithm, discussed above [@Bry1971]. Following @Harding2002, a censoring rule based on a minimum of 6 months for each phase and 15 months for a full cycle is applied. The comovement between these cycle phases can be measured with the concordance statistic suggested by @Harding2002, introduced in chapter 3. The concordance statistic measures the co-movement of two series, by considering the proportion of time the two series are simultaneously in the same phase. Following @Harding2006, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors are used to calculate statistical significance.

Table 4.6 reports the concordance statistics for the phases of the indices, with the Cape wheat Index compared to the UK wheat index, and the Cape WPI compared to the UK WPI and the US WPI. Cape wheat prices exhibited significant concordance with UK wheat prices, with a lag of around 6 months. In other words, phases in UK wheat prices led Cape wheat prices by around 6 months. The Cape WPI exhibited significant concordance with the UK WPI, with a lag of between 3 and 12 months. The highest concordance statistic was when phases in the UK WPI led the Cape WPI by 8 months. Hence, there is significant concordance in the cyclical phases of wholesale prices in the UK and the Cape Colony.

These comparisons imply deviations from Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) over the period. However, because the estimated Cape WPI is heavily dependent on the prices of agricultural and raw materials, and because they include far fewer products than the UK and US indices, the comparisons should be used for illustrative purposes rather than precise calculations. Even if the indices captured price levels accurately, PPP is unlikely to hold exactly, even in periods with no barriers to trade and more stable and integrated commodity and financial markets [@Klovland2014a]. 

###Summary
The wholesale commodity price indices estimated with the repeat sales method seem to conform to the economic history of the Cape Colony. The wholesale price indices provide some insights into the supply and demand developments over the period, especially around the Second South African War. In general, prices exhibited a pronounced cyclical trend over the period, with a large increase before and during the war and a large decrease after the war up to Unification. The total WPI seems to reflect the monetary history better than the existing CPIs and seems plausible when compared to international price indices.

##Results: Pricing Dynamics
The high-frequency prices can also be used to gain some insight into the pricing behaviour over this period of the Cape Colony's history. The general increase in prices (inflation) is the result of many adjustments. Only a fraction of prices change in a particular month and price changes may vary in size. 

Following @Ruch2016a and @Ruch2016, this section investigates the frequency and size of price changes to examine the underlying dynamics of pricing behaviour. Price changes are decomposed into an extensive margin, i.e. the fraction of prices changing in a specific month, and an intensive margin, i.e. the size of price changes. These decompositions are typically used to identify the underlying price dynamics and to choose which models better replicate the empirical properties in the data. Models of pricing dynamics generally fall into two categories: time-dependent or state-dependent. In time-dependent models firms set prices randomly (e.g. @Calvo1983), or every nth period (e.g. @Taylor1998). In state-dependent models firms change prices once the change is larger than the "menu cost" (e.g. @Mankiw1985). 

This section then uses a simple method to calculate inflation, which is compared to the repeat sales inflation rate, in order to gauge the internal validity of the indices. In addition, the extensive and intensive margins are used to decompose inflation into more sticky and flexible components.

A price change is defined as: $dp_{ikt} = (p_{ikt} - p_{ikt-1})*100$, where $p_{ikt}$ is the log price of a specific product $i$ in town $k$ in time $t$. For example, the change in the log price of wheat in Cape Town from one month to the next. The mean of these price changes $dp_{it}$ is calculated over all the towns for each commodity. Figure 4.17 plots the distribution (histogram) of the price changes, in 5% bands, as well as the distribution of the normalised price changes. The monthly changes are dominated by no change or small changes, with around 86% of changes smaller than 10% in either direction. Three very large price changes occurred for tobacco, cattle and sheep in 1900 during the war. For comparison, @Ruch2016 recently analysed the prices of the goods included in the current CPI and found that monthly price changes were dominated by no change, which accounted for 75%, while 80% of changes were smaller than 5% in either direction.

    }

```

An indicator variable is created to calculate the frequency of price changes: $$I_{ikt} = \begin{cases} 1,& \text{if } dp_{ikt} \neq 0\\ 0,& \text{otherwise }\\ \end{cases}$$ The mean of the indicator variable $I_{it}$ is then calculated for each commodity over all the towns, as above. The indicator variable $I_{it}$ is therefore equal to the mean frequency of price changes. Figure 4.18 illustrates the annual mean and median of the frequency of monthly price changes over the period. The means and medians are similar, with averages of 59% and 60% over the sample period. The frequency of price changes is relatively high initially, increases during the war and then decreases thereafter. The weighted versions very similar. The inverse of the frequency measure provides a rough approximation of the duration in months between price changes. The mean frequency implies that the prices of goods changed on average every 1.6 months, or 50 days. For comparison, @Ruch2016 found that the prices of the goods included in the current CPI changed every 3.6 months (according to the mean frequency). One would expect more frequent and larger price changes in the historical sample, because of the inclusion of mostly agricultural goods and raw materials.

These calculations may be used to decompose inflation into more sticky and more flexible components. This provides an internal validity check of the inflation history, this time using only the data from the Agricultural Journals. The first step is to calculate the weighted inflation rates from the average price changes for each commodity $dp_{it}$ for all the towns. The 1904 census weights are applied to calculated weighted price changes; the same weights as were used to calculate the overall WPI: $\pi_{it} = w_{it} (p_{it} - p_{it-1})$, where $\pi_{it}$ is monthly inflation, $w_{it}$ is the production value weight, and $p_{it}$ is the log price of a specific product $i$ in time $t$.

The missing data problem is amplified when inflation is calculated as simple period-on-period growth rates, as every missing price observation leads to three missing inflation observations. In these historical records, every commodity price series in a particular town contains many missing observations. In some cases there are long periods where no prices were recorded. In this case it is assumed that prices were constant in the missing periods. The results are similar if they are interpolated with the WPI inflation values.

The next step is to decompose inflation into sticky and flexible price inflation components: 
$$\pi_{it} = \pi^S_{t} + \pi^F_{t}$$ 
$$\pi_{it} = \sum^n_{i=1} w_{it} I^S_i \pi_{it} + \sum^n_{i=1} w_{it} I^F_i \pi_{it}$$
where $\pi_{it}$ is the month-on-month inflation rate; $\pi^S_{t}$ and $\pi^F_{t}$ are sticky and flexible price inflation; $w_{it}$ are the weights for each commodity; $I^S_i$ is an indicator variable equal to 1 if $I_{i} \leq T$ and 0 otherwise; $I^F_i$ is equal to 1 if $I_{i} > T$ and 0 otherwise; $T$ is a threshold value for the frequency of price changes determining which prices are considered sticky or flexible. 

Following @Ruch2016, the mean of the frequency changes is used as a starting point for the threshold value $T$. A threshold value of 60%, reflecting the mean of the frequency changes, led to most of the products being included in the sticky index. A slightly lower threshold value of 50% is therefore chosen. Using this threshold value led to the inclusion of products such as tobacco, meat (e.g. beef) and livestock (e.g. cattle) prices in the sticky index, as they tended to change less frequently. Products such as wheat, mealies, butter and eggs were included in the flexible index, as they tended to change more frequently.

Figure 4.19 illustrates the monthly year-on-year inflation rates for overall, sticky and flexible inflation, based on a frequency change threshold of 50%, as well as the inflation rate from the WPI. The decomposition of inflation into these components generates a more volatile flexible price inflation series with higher amplitude, and a more persistent sticky-price inflation index that may capture underlying inflation trends. However, the resulting sticky price inflation does not really reflect "core" inflation as it is typically defined in the literature (e.g. @Roger1998; @Ruch2016a), as most of the products are agricultural goods.

The WPI and the decomposed inflation rates are similar and highly correlated, as reported in Table 4.7. The biggest difference is the higher inflation rates in 1899 for the WPI, which is due to inclusion of the extra products in the Blue Books. The repeat sales method therefore provides a similar inflation history as the simple method employed above (i.e. the weighted sum of inflation rates including only the Agricultural Journal records). The advantage of the repeat sales method is that it is a consistent way of dealing with the incomplete or missing price records.

In summary, the pricing dynamics indicate that monthly changes were dominated by zero or small changes, with around 86% of changes smaller than 10% in either direction. The frequency of price changes was relatively high, with the prices of goods changing on average every 50 days, although the frequency of changes decreased markedly after the war. The following section presents some evidence on the course of internal market integration in the Cape Colony over this period.

##Market Integration
To date there has been little research on regional market integration in the Cape Colony around the turn of the 20th century, which was presumably aided by the development of the railways. Market integration occurs along two dimensions: convergence and efficiency. Equilibrium prices should be equal after trading costs (i.e. the law of one price should hold), and prices should return quickly to this equilibrium after a shock (i.e. there should be a degree of efficiency) [@Chilosi2013]. 

The high-frequency indices developed in this chapter, as well as other aggregate indicators, can aid the investigation along both dimensions [@Ejrnæs2008]. This section studies regional wholesale price indices, as well as measures of cross-sectional price dispersion between the towns in the Cape Colony, for evidence of increasing internal market integration. The section tests the hypotheses that price dispersion between towns was declining over the period and that regional prices indices were cointegrated. This part of the chapter builds on the work of @Boshoff2017, by expanding the period and the number of products, and considering on both dimensions of market integration (i.e. convergence and efficiency).

The tests are carried out for a number of commodities, as opposed to focusing on wheat, which is the most common commodity analysed in the literature [@Klovland2005]. @Federico2012 found substantial differences between patterns of convergence for different commodities in the first half of the 19th century in Europe and concluded that one should be cautious in accepting the results for wheat as representative for all commodities. The examination of price behaviour at the individual commodity level should be the most appropriate way of evaluating trends in commodity prices [@Razzaque2007]. 

###Methodology: Tests of Market Integration
Cournot characterised an integrated market as "*an entire territory of which the parts are so united by the relations of unrestricted commerce that prices take the same level throughout with ease and rapidity.*" The first dimension concerns the convergence of prices for the same goods are throughout the economy. Market integration along this dimension features a decline in price gaps or dispersion [@Federico2012]. Decreasing transportation costs should lead to lower price dispersion and more integrated markets [@Andrabi2010]. The second dimension concerns the efficiency with which price gaps return to equilibrium after a shock. This reflects growing market efficiency, especially through better circulation of information about prices and fundamentals [@Federico2013]. @Federico2013 argues that price level convergence is more important than the adjustment to equilibrium, as actual price dispersion determines decisions by consumers and producers.

There is a growing literature on market integration in economic history (see @Federico2012 for a review of the literature). The literature divides the tests of market integration into tests for convergence and tests of efficiency. Trends in price gaps or dispersion are tested by looking at pairwise trends in relative prices or, for a large number of markets, by trends in the coefficient of variation (e.g. @Klovland2005, and @Chilosi2013). Tests of efficiency typically involve time-series correlation and cointegration methods (e.g. @Federico2013 and @Boshoff2017). The following section presents the market integration tests used in this chapter, along the dimensions of convergence and efficiency.

####Tests of Convergence
Most of the literature on market integration is based on the idea that when transaction costs are small and information is shared, price differences are quickly arbitraged away and prices converge [@Chilosi2013]. In a competitive equilibrium, price differences are equal to trading costs. If trading costs are smaller than price differences, traders would arbitrage away the differential to make a profit. Thus, arbitrage should ensure that homogeneous commodities sell for one price, after taking trading costs into account [@Chilosi2013]. One way to test for market integration is to measure the extent to which prices of the same commodities converge over time [@ORourke2004]. Price convergence between locations can be examined graphically, or estimated more formally with a regression of price trends [@Federico2012].

This chapter tests directly for this type of market integration by testing for price convergence between the towns in the Cape Colony. This section examines two relatively simple measures of cross-sectional price dispersion between the towns in the Cape Colony, and studies how they behaved over time. Both of these are aggregation measures, related to the measures used in chapter 3. 

The first is based on the measure of absolute deviations suggested by @Klovland2005, which examines the development of the annual absolute deviations over time. For a group consisting of $K$ towns, the absolute deviation (AD) for commodity $i$ is defined as: $AD_{it} = \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1} Abs(1- P_{kit}/\mu_{it})$, where $P_{kit}$ is the price of commodity $i$ in town $k$ month $t$, and $\mu_{it}$ is the cross-sectional average price of commodity $i$ in month $t$ across all the towns $\mu_{it} = \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1} P_{kit}$. $AD_{it}$ is therefore a measure of the average absolute deviation for a specific commodity across all of the towns over time. The absolute value is used to avoid positive and negative price gaps averaging out. This measure reflects the extent of deviations from the law of one price over time. If the price gaps for a specific product between towns are large, the index will show relatively high values. Consider two extreme cases. If the law of one price held exactly for all the towns, $AD_{it}$ would equal zero, whereas and if price gaps were 100%, the measure would equal 1. A decreasing absolute deviation over time implies price convergence and increasing market integration [@Klovland2005]. 

The second measure looks at dispersion by computing the cross-sectional coefficient of variation (CV), i.e. the standard deviation normalised by the mean. The CV is a popular measure for investigating price convergence in the literature (e.g. see @Federico2012, @Federico2013, @Chilosi2013). The coefficient of variation (CV) for commodity $i$ is defined as: $CV_{it} = \sigma_{it}/\mu_{it}$, where $\mu_{it}$ is again the average price across towns, and $\sigma_{it}$ is the cross-sectional standard deviation of prices across towns $\sigma_{it} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum^K_{k=1} (P_{kit} - \mu_{it})}$. A higher CV implies that prices are more dispersed between the towns. A decreasing CV over time implies price convergence and increasing market integration.

To test for price convergence, it is therefore necessary to test the AD and CV series for a decreasing trend. To test this formally the trend in these two measures can be explored by running the following log-linear regression on either the AD or CV series: $ln CV_t = \alpha + \beta TIME + \epsilon_t$. A negative and significant coefficient for the trend variable $TIME$ is evidence of convergence and of integration [@Federico2012]. This model assumes that the process is trend-stationary. Unit root tests indicate that this is the case for most of the AD and CV series. 

A number of authors (e.g. @Bleaney1993, @Razzaque2007, @Federico2012) have estimated error-correction models to take into account the possibility that the series follows a difference-stationary process: $\Delta lnCV_t = \alpha + \beta TIME + \psi lnCV_{t-1} + \phi \Delta lnCV_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$. This model is in the form of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, which encompasses both the trend and difference stationary models [@Razzaque2007]. The lagged dependent variable is included to take account of potential serial correlation. 

There are four possibilities [@Bleaney1993]. If $\beta = 0$ and $\psi = 0$, the series has a random walk with zero mean. If $\beta = 0$ and $-1 < \psi < 0$, the series has no long term but tends to be pulled back towards its historic mean. If $\beta \neq 0$ and $\psi = 0$, the series has a random walk with drift, so that if $\beta$ is negative, it is more probable that it will be less than its current value. If $\beta \neq 0$ and $-1 < \psi < 0$, the series has a non-zero deterministic trend to which it reverts after a shock. The long-run trend rate can be computed as $t = -(\beta/\psi)$. A negative trend implies long-run convergence and integration [@Federico2012]. 

####Tests of efficiency
One would expect prices in markets that are integrated to move together over time. The intuition is that there is a limit to how far prices can diverge before either demand-side or supply-side substitution forces them back in line. Time series methods, such as correlations and cointegration, can be used to investigate how closely prices move together over time [@Klovland2005]. According to @Federico2012, the measures of efficiency can be classified into three groups. First, arbitrage forces prices to move together (comovement tests). Second, arbitrage forces price differentials to return to their equilibrium level after a shock (cointegration tests). Third, arbitrage reduces the effect of local shocks and thus the volatility of prices (variance tests).

Following @Boshoff2017, this section studies contemporaneous correlations and cointegration to test for short term and long term relationships in the high-frequency commodity price indices. The difficulty is that the price series for the individual towns have large gaps, which is the reason for implementing the repeat sales regression above. To implement the time series tests for efficiency (e.g. cointegration tests) would require substantial interpolation to form continuous series. In many cases, large parts of specific commodity-town series would just be straight lines between two observations with no variation. One alternative is to split the data into geographical regions, and to use the repeat sales method to calculate indices for these regions. By combining the price records for a number of town for each product, much more continuous price indices can be estimated. The time series tests therefore focus on regional indices.

To test for a long term relationship, this section employs the bounds testing method suggested by @Pesaran2001. The aim for the bounds test is to test for the presence of a levels relationship regardless of the order of integration of input variables [@Boshoff2011b]. It has the advantage that it does not suffer from the potential unit root pre-testing bias, and input variables may be $I(0)$, $I(1)$, or cointegrated [@Philips2016].

The bounds test is based on an unrestricted or conditional error-correction model: 
$$\Delta p_{1,t} = \alpha_{0} + \sum^q_{i=1} \alpha_{1,i} \Delta p_{1,t-i} + \sum^q_{i=0} \alpha_{2,i} \Delta p_{2,t-i} + \beta_{1} p_{1,t-1} + \beta_{2} p_{2,t-1} + \epsilon_{p1,t}$$
Where $p_{1,t}$ and $p_{2,t}$ are the price indices, which are assumed to be $I(0)$, $I(1)$, or cointegrated; and $\epsilon_{p1,t}$ and $\epsilon_{p2,t}$ are white noise error terms. 

From this models one can test for the existence of a long-run relationship between $p_{1,t}$ and $p_{2,t}$. The test statistic is the F-test for the statistical significance of lagged variables in levels in the model. Formally, the null and alternative hypotheses can be stated as follows: $H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \cap \beta_2 = 0$. $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0 \cup \beta_2 \neq 0$. The alternative hypothesis also covers the degenerate cases: $\beta_1 \neq 0$ and $\beta_2 = 0$; $\beta_1 = 0$ and $\beta_2 = 0$.

This test involves multiple parameter restrictions and are usually tested using an F-statistic, which is compared with some critical value. The F-distribution for these joint hypotheses depends on the order of integration of the price variables. @Pesaran2001 suggest a bounds testing approach relying on two critical values. They derive asymptotic distributions for the test statistic that assume either all variables $I(0)$ or $I(1)$. These two sets form the upper and lower bounds of the test. If the test statistic exceeds the upper bound or falls below the lower bound the inference is straightforward, but the outcome is unknown when the test statistic falls between the two bounds. In the latter case, it would be necessary to still test for stationarity beforehand. They develop separate critical values for different specifications involving deterministic components (trends and intercept) of the VAR [@Boshoff2011b]. 

The following section presents the results for the tests of convergence and efficiency. The tests for convergence look at price gaps and dispersion across all the towns in the Cape Colony over time. The tests of efficiency examine regional market efficiency between towns in the present day Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Northern Cape distinguishing between the periods before and after the war.

###Results: Market Integration
Figure 4.20 and Figure 4.21 illustrate the monthly AD and CV measures for selected commodities. The two measures provide very similar evidence, which is reflected in their high correlations reported in Table 4.8. The absolute deviations and coefficients of variation are relatively low for these commodities. For comparison, @Federico2013 found that the coefficient of variation for wheat prices in European markets declined from a peak of slightly below 0.4 during the Napoleonic wars to about 0.10-0.15 in the heyday of free trade in the 1870s. In this sample, the CV for wheat was around 0.15 over the period.

Both measures suggest a declining trend over the sample period. To test this more formally, the simple model (Model 1), as well as the extended error-correction form (Model 2) were estimated using both measures for 15 commodities.[^45] The lagged level dependent variable $\psi$ was negative and significant in all cases (using the Dickey-Fuller distribution), except for boer meal. For the most part the diagnostic tests for normality, homoscedasticity, and no serial correlation are satisfied. 

[^45]: The following products were excluded because of limited data: lucerne hay, bread, pigs, and horses. The prices for oxen, cows, and woolled sheep were incorporated into the series for cattle and sheep.  

Table 4.9 reports the coefficients for the time trend variable $\beta$ for Model 1 and the long-run trend rate $t = -(\beta/\psi)$ for Model 2. Overall there is strong evidence of convergence, as 13 of the 16 commodities showed evidence of a declining trend over the sample period. There is strong evidence of convergence for wheat flour, mealies, oats, oat-hay, tobacco, butter, and eggs, as all models point to a significant negative trend. There is weaker evidence of convergence for wheat, potatoes, beef, mutton, and cattle, in the sense that the simpler models point to a decreasing trend. The commodities that did not converge over the period, mealie meal and barley, already had low values of price dispersion, and their prices revert towards the historic mean.

The significant monthly trend rates imply annual growth rates that range between -0.48% and -3.67% per annum for Model 1 and between -0.53% and -1.12% per annum for Model 2. This is in line with the literature. For example, in similar exercises, @Federico2013's estimates range between -0.5 and -1.75 per annum, and @Razzaque2007's range between -0.8% and -1.4% for one dataset and -0.92% and -3.27% for another dataset.

The tests of efficiency examine regional market efficiency between towns in the present day Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Northern Cape. This is because the commodity prices for the individual towns contain too many missing observations for time series analysis.[^46] The repeat sales method is used to calculate regional wholesale price indices for the 16 individual products for these three regions. Figure 4.22 illustrates the regional indices of four selected products.

[^46]: Unfortunately, an analysis that distinguished between the towns along the main and branch railway lines was also prohibited by a lack of price observations for the towns on the branch lines. Such an analysis may be undertaken as new price records are added in future.

To determine if market efficiency increased over the period, the sample is divided into two periods: the period before the war, i.e. from October 1889 to September 1899, and the post-war period, i.e. from June 1902 to August 1914. The second period corresponds to the second rapid expansion in railway lines. The war-time period is excluded to avoid the possibility of overstating integration, as the regions were subject to the same exogenous shock [@Federico2012]. The efficiency test are applied to the two periods separately, as well as for the entire sample period. One would expect efficiency between the regions to improve in the post-war period.

Table 4.10 reports the contemporaneous correlations for the growth rates in commodity prices between the regions. On the whole the regional markets seem to have been relatively well integrated over the short term, as 11 of the 16 commodities showed significant positive correlations between two regions (especially wheat, mealies, potatoes and eggs). The commodities that did not exhibit significant correlations, include butter, beef, and sheep. For a number of commodities, the short-term correlations between the Western and Eastern Cape prices were higher and more significant in the post-war period (e.g. wheat flour, mealie meal, potatoes and eggs). There was no clear increase in the correlations between the Northern Cape indices and those for the other two regions in the post-war period. Overall, the Northern Cape commodity price indices exhibited higher correlations with the Eastern Cape indices than the Western Cape indices.

Table 4.11 reports the results for the bounds test for long-term cointegrating relationships between regional price indices (F-statistic reported). The price indices for the Western Cape are used as the regressors $p_2$ in the relevant models, and the Eastern Cape series are used as the regressors $p_2$ in their models with the Northern Cape. The critical values are those derived in @Pesaran2001, assuming that both series are $I(1)$, and including an intercept term in the VAR model. The AIC is used to select the appropriate number of lags.

The results indicate that the regional markets were relatively well integrated over the longer term, as evidenced by the cointegrating relationships for commodities such as boer meal, potatoes, butter and eggs. However, the test for butter and eggs should be interpreted with caution, as the unit root tests indicate that some of the series might be stationary, depending on the specification. Only a few commodities did not exhibit significant long term relationships, such as wheat flour. For a number of commodities, the long-term relationships between the Western and Eastern Cape prices were higher and more significant in the post-war period (e.g. boer meal, potatoes, tobacco and cattle). The long term relationships between the Northern Cape indices and those for the other two regions were more significant in some cases, but the results was not consistent for all commodities. On the whole, the price indices for the three regions seem to have been equally well integrated, as only a couple of products did not show much evidence of a significant long term relationship. 

###Summary
Although the data is patchy and the evidence necessarily imperfect, the results indicate that there is evidence of increasing market integration between towns in the Cape Colony over the sample period, despite the destruction and displacement caused by the war.

There is strong evidence of convergence in prices across towns, as 13 of the 16 commodities showed evidence of a declining trend over the sample period. There is strong evidence of convergence for wheat flour, mealies, oats, oat-hay, tobacco, butter, and eggs, as all models point to a significant negative trend. There is weaker evidence of convergence for wheat, potatoes, beef, mutton, and cattle, in the sense that the simpler models point to a decreasing trend.

On the whole the regional markets seem to have been relatively well integrated over the short term, as well as the long term. The regional commodity price indices exhibited significant positive correlations for 11 of the 16 commodities. Most of the commodities also showed evidence of a significant cointegrating relationship between two regional price indices. For a number of commodities the short-term correlations and long-term cointegrating relationships between the Western and Eastern Cape prices were higher and more significant in the post-war period.

In all likelihood the increasing market integration was aided by the development of the railway network. A number of railway lines had been completed just before or during the sample period, and there was significant investment in branch lines to act as feeders to the trunk lines or as connections between them. Rail transport seems to have substituted expensive road transport to the interior, creating a somewhat integrated market for commodities transported along the rail network [@Boshoff2017]. 

While the development of railways was no doubt important, it was not the only factor have could have helped with market integration [@Andrabi2010]. There were also a number of significant changes in technology and infrastructure, such as telegraphs and roads, occurring before and during this time which could have contributed to price convergence. Better information sharing throughout the country may have alerted producers to large price differences of which they could take advantage. The unification of the four colonies probably also contributed, through institutional changes such as the elimination of internal tariffs and the use of a common currency. 

##Conclusion
Technological developments over the past few decades have enabled scholars to capture and analyse African historical statistics on a much larger scale than before. Historical statistics, and higher frequency records in particular, are often incomplete [@Klovland2014a]. The primary aim of this chapter was to explore aggregation methods to develop relatively continuous monthly wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony, using incomplete historical records. The indices were based on an expanded version of the historical dataset used in @Boshoff2017, which captures high-frequency market prices in the Agricultural Journals, as well as newly digitised annual prices from the Cape Colony Blue Books.

Following @Klovland2014a, the chapter has argued that the repeat sales approach is a useful technique for aggregating incomplete information from various sources. The repeat sales method was used to aggregate the incomplete data to form relatively continuous time series, which reflect the mean in the growth rates of the distribution. The repeat sales method provides a consistent way to aggregate the price data and produces indices with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series. 

The wholesale commodity price indices estimated with the repeat sales method accord well with the economic history of the Cape Colony. The wholesale price indices provide some insights into the supply and demand developments over the period, especially around the Second South African War. In general, prices exhibited a pronounced cyclical trend over the period, with a large increase before and during the war and a large decrease after the war up to Unification. The total WPI provides a clearer picture of the inflation history of the period in that it reflects the monetary history better than the existing measures.

The secondary aim of this chapter was to use the high-frequency price data to investigate internal market integration in the Cape Colony. To date there has been little research on regional market integration in the Cape Colony around the turn of the 20th century. The market integration tests investigated both dimensions of market integration, i.e. convergence and efficiency. The results indicates that there is evidence of market integration over the period. The evidence indicates that price dispersion between towns declined for a number of products and that the regional prices for a number of products were correlated and cointegrated.

The chapter has attempted to make four contributions to the literature. The first was to demonstrate methods to aggregate incomplete information from various sources. The repeat sales method employed in this chapter may prove useful in a diverse range of applications where the information is incomplete. It may be useful to estimate more continuous indices, for example for incomes, wages, and volumes, especially when the information from various sources can be combined. 

The second contribution was to digitise two large new sets of historical records on market prices in the Cape Colony. The first is an expanded version of the Agricultural Journal records used in @Boshoff2017, which captures high-frequency market prices, and the second is a set of records on annual prices from the Cape Colony Blue Books. These new datasets will be of use to economic historians doing research on this period of the Cape Colony's history.

The third contribution was to apply the repeat sales method to these relatively large historical microeconomic database to calculate monthly wholesale commodity prices indices for the Cape Colony. The price indices, reported in the Appendix below, are useful for investigating the inflation history of the Cape Colony can shed new light on selected episodes in the economic and financial history. In wartime periods the price level may be among the few available time series that can be accurately measured, and may convey information on the state of the economy [@Klovland2014a]. Further research might supplement the indices by including prices from other sources, and potentially import and export prices. Another extension would be to add prices from the other territories in South Africa, i.e. Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, to investigate and compare the price histories of the four territories.

The fourth contribution was to use the high-frequency price indices, as well as the underlying data, to test for evidence of increasing market integration in the Cape Colony over this period. Potential further research could investigate convergence between towns along the main and branch railway lines, as more records for specific towns are added. An extension would be to try some other tests of market integration. The factors that aided the integration could also be investigated, as well as the impact of market integration on welfare and long term growth [@Federico2012]. The relatively continuous high-frequency price indices, as well as the underlying data, can facilitate these inquiries.

##Appendix
###Repeat Sales Example 
Following @Klovland2014a, a simple example from the data may be used to illustrate the repeat sales approach. Table 4.12 reports the wheat prices per 100lbs in 3 towns over a period of 10 months. The purpose is to calculate a price index for this period, given the missing observations (NAs) in the data. The main challenge is to put the data together in a consistent way. For period 3 it would be natural to combine the price increases from Beaufort West and Cape Town. For the other periods there are a number of ways to splice the time series. In practice, with many time series, such procedures would be very difficult and time consuming to handle consistently.

```{r table4.12, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
#Toy Example
toy <- dcast(comdata, time_id + datum ~ town, mean, value.var="wheat")
toy <- toy[21:30,c("time_id","datum","Beaufort West","Cape Town","Worcester")]
toy$t <- 1:nrow(toy)
#toy1$lnvalue <- log(toy1$value) 

maak <- function(naam) {
    toy2 <- toy
    toy2 <- toy2[!is.na(toy[,naam]),c(naam,"t")]
    for(i in 1:(nrow(toy2)-1)) {
        toy2$P[1] <- 0
        toy2$P[i+1] <- log(toy2[i+1,naam]/toy2[i,naam])
    }
    xmat <- array(0, dim = c(nrow(toy2)-1, nrow(toy))) 
    for(i in 1:(nrow(toy2)-1)) {
        xmat[i,toy2$t[i]] <- -1
        xmat[i,toy2$t[i+1]] <- 1
    }
    einde <- cbind(toy2$P[-1],xmat)  
    return(einde)
}

einde <- as.data.frame(rbind(maak("Beaufort West"),maak("Cape Town"),maak("Worcester")))
dy <- einde$V1
xmat <- as.matrix(einde[,2:ncol(einde)])

rsales <- lm(dy ~ xmat + 0)
rs_index <- as.data.frame(exp(rsales$coefficients))
n <- rs_index[1,1]
rs_index <- rs_index/n*100
rs_index <- na.locf(rs_index)

toy <- cbind(toy,rs_index)
toy <- toy[,c(2,3,4,5,7)]
colnames(toy)[c(1,5)] <- c("Date","Index")

xt <- xtable(toy, caption="Repeat sales example with wheat prices")
print(xt, "latex", include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE, 
      caption.placement = getOption("xtable.caption.placement", "top"), scalebox = 0.9)
```

The repeat sales method uses a simple least squares regression on time dummies to produce the estimated index values. Repeat sales pairs are formed from the price relatives of the same commodity (in this case wheat) for each town. For example, for Beaufort West, 3 sales pairs can be formed (e.g. 135/150). The sample consists of 12 sales pairs and 10 time dummies are created for the 10 time periods, reported in Table 4.13. The first sales pair corresponds to the first two observations for Beaufort West, with a price decrease of 10.5% between period 1 and 2 and time dummies of -1 and 1 for the first two periods. The other rows are derived in the same manner. Running a least squares regression on this dataset produces a set of coefficient estimates for the 10 dummy variables. Taking the antilog to these estimates produces the index in Table 4.12. In this case the additional prices from Worcester help to make the index continuous, specifically by adding price observations in the 4th and 8th periods, where there were only missing observations. Thus, including more price series will lead to fewer gaps in the index. Even if the prices are at different levels due to factors such as transport costs, for the purposes of the index the trends (or growth rates) are compared over time.

```{r table4.13, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
colnames(einde) <- c("ln(Pt/Ps)","D1","D2","D3","D4","D5","D6","D7","D8","D9","D10")
xt <- xtable(einde, caption="Rgression input of repeat sales example with wheat prices",digits=c(3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))
print(xt, "latex", include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE, 
      caption.placement = getOption("xtable.caption.placement", "top"), scalebox = 0.9)
```

This approach treats all observations as equal, which means that towns observed more frequently than others will exert a stronger influence on the index, simply because there will be more observations in the dataset originating from this item. For example, if Cape Town wheat prices are recorded and included in the index calculations more frequently than Worcester prices, the Cape Town prices will have a larger implicit weighting in the index. In other words, the prices of the same commodity in different towns are treated equally and towns with more observations have a higher implicit weighting. This might be a sensible approach, as regularly quoted prices are often the most frequently traded @Klovland2014a. 

It is possible that the smaller towns have more price observations in some periods which do not properly reflect price movements in the larger towns, which might then bias the index to some degree. For instance, there might be an idiosyncratic spike in Worcester wheat prices in a period where only Worcester prices were reported. However, idiosyncratic price movements in specific towns are less likely to bias the overall indices because the estimates include a large number of towns from two separate datasets. 

The repeat sales method therefore provides a consistent way to aggregate the data from the different towns for a specific commodity. This method also generates an index with substantially fewer gaps than there are in the individual series.
