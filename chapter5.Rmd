#Conclusion
In the modern world, large microeconomic datasets are becoming increasing available, and will become more commonplace in the future. This provides an opportunity to improve upon the measurement of a range of economic phenomena and to bolster economic research [@Schutt2013]. The abundance of inexpensive computing power is making it possible to process these large amounts of data in order to form useful information. One way in which these large amounts of microdata sets can aid economic analysis is to construct better macroeconomic indicators.

The primary aim of this dissertation was to create macro time series from the relatively large micro datasets. All three datasets have shortcomings which make it challenging to estimate time series indicators. Similar techniques were used to overcome some of these challenges, often for the first time in the South African setting, to create useful macroeconomic indicators. The secondary aim was to use the indicators and the underlying data to answer some specific questions in each setting.

##Business Sentiment
The primary aim of this chapter was to try to improve on the existing measures of sentiment for South Africa, using the microdata from the BER's business tendency surveys. Although measuring business sentiment is not straightforward, survey-based indicators can be helpful in discovering agents' opinions on future economic developments [@OECD2003]. Survey-based measures have the advantage that they are derived from opinions of key economic agents [@Girardi2015], are available with a shorter lag than official statistics, and are usually not subject to revisions [@ECB2013]. 

This chapter calculated composite indicators of business confidence and uncertainty. These composite indicators incorporated the survey responses from a number of questions on current conditions and forward-looking expectations. The responses were systematically weighted to produce sectoral indicators, including the survey of the services sector, as well as aggregate indicators. The composite confidence indicators were calculated as the cross-sectional mean of responses to questions on current and expected future conditions [@OECD2003]. The composite uncertainty indicators were calculated as the cross-sectional standard deviation of forward-looking responses and the cross-sectional mean and standard deviation in individual firm expectation errors [@Arslan2011; @Bachmann2013; @Girardi2015]. A composite overall measure of uncertainty was constructed, which combined the survey-based uncertainty indicators with financial market uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty. 

The new composite indicators were compared to the existing measures for South Africa and seemed to provide plausible results. The indicators were evaluated in terms of how well they tracked the reference series, real GDP growth. The new confidence indicators tracked real GDP growth closely and seemed to improve on the existing measures. The combined uncertainty indicator appeared to be the most plausible proxy for macroeconomic uncertainty in South Africa and appeared to track real GDP growth rates more closely than any of the individual components separately.

The secondary aim of this chapter was to examine the relationship between business sentiment and real activity in South Africa, using an agnostic VAR framework. The chapter tried to establish if there was a significant relationship between the indicators and real GDP growth, the timing of this relationship, and if it remains significant after taking other economic variables into account. Overall, the rudimentary evidence seemed to indicate that there is at least strong comovement between the indicators and economic activity, and that they contain potentially useful predictive information.

The confidence indicators seemed to contain relevant information for predicting output growth. A shock to the confidence indicators was followed by a significant increase in real GDP growth in the VAR models. This was the case for the aggregate indicators as well as the sectoral indicators. The indicators provided advanced warning of turning points, although there were a few false positives. This implies that these confidence indicators are potentially useful for monitoring economic developments in a timely manner and for forecasting future economic activity. All the uncertainty indicators appeared to be counter-cyclical in the sense that they exhibited a significant negative correlation with real GDP growth, albeit at different horizons. Shocks to uncertainty were generally followed by a decrease in real GDP growth. The combined uncertainty indicator seemed to exhibit a stronger relationship with real GDP growth than any of the measures separately. The results from the larger VAR systems seemed confirm the findings in the simple bivariate VARs. The impact of the shocks were larger on real production and investment growth than on real GDP growth, as the theory would predict [@Bloom2009]. 

A number of studies have estimated these larger systems in levels (e.g. @Bachmann2013), as opposed to the growth rates used in this dissertation. Further analysis could investigate larger systems in levels, which may allow longer term relationships to emerge. A further avenue for investigation would be to test whether there is asymmetry in the frequency horizon of shock effects. Deeper or systemic shocks may be associated with medium-term, rather than high-frequency fluctuations in output. An extension would be to test whether the relationship is non-linear or asymmetric, depending on the size or duration of the change in sentiment. The forecasting ability of sentiment indicators might be completely offset by other indicators during ordinary times, while increasing notably in the presence of unusual events. Moreover, the relation during a recovery phase (and potentially late stages of a recession) may be different from the relation during the rest of an expansion. Further analysis could focus specifically on trying to determine whether there is a causal role for sentiment in the business cycle. It may also be instructive to determine what factors influence the sentiment indicators [@Bloom2014].

The evidence seems to suggest that there is some potentially useful predictive information in the indicators. The indicators may therefore be useful in larger forecasting exercises. A related avenue for investigation would be to assess the usefulness of the indicators in improving out-of-sample forecasts. Significant in-sample evidence of forecasting power does not guarantee significant out-of-sample ability. The usefulness of the confidence indicators for real-time forecasting could also be analysed, given that they are available around two months before many official series. The confidence indicators could be analysed further to see if they provide accurate early warning signals for business cycle turning points. The analysis could be expanded by analysing the cyclical properties of the indicators in terms of duration, amplitude and steepness. 

##Art Prices
The primary aim of this chapter was to construct quality-adjusted South African art price indices, using a relatively large database of auction prices. Estimating accurate indicators for unique items such as artworks can be challenging. Artworks are less liquid than traditional assets and have a low transaction frequency, which means that only a small part of the overall market is traded at any given time. They are also typically unique or heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to compare different artworks over time [@Hansen2009].

This chapter used three broad methodologies to develop price indices for South African art: central tendency methods, hedonic methods and hybrid repeat sales methods. The chapter argues that central tendency measures do not adequately control for quality-mix or compositional changes over time. Various indices were estimated with the hedonic regression method, which is able to control more adequately for quality-mix changes by attributing implicit prices to a set of asset characteristics. The main shortcoming of the hedonic method is that it has potential omitted variable bias, which might bias the indices. The scarcity of repeat sales observations in the database limited the usefulness of the classical repeated sales approach in this case. The chapter therefore proposed a simple new hybrid or pseudo-repeat sales methodology, which acted as a type of robustness test. This approach addressed the problem of scarcity of repeat sales and to some extent the potential omitted variable bias inherent in the hedonic method.

The indices estimated with the regression-based methods seemed to point to the same general trend in South African art prices, which provides some confidence that potential omitted variable bias and sample selection bias are not pervasive in this case [@Calomiris2016]. The trends seem plausible, compared to international art price indices and other South African assets. The indices were evaluated in terms of smoothness metrics, which suggested that the 1-year adjacent period hedonic index performed the best, although the regression-based indices were similar. 

The secondary aim of the chapter was to study the estimated art price indices for evidence of a bubble. The direct bubble detection tests proposed by @Phillips2011 were used to investigate whether South African art prices exhibited mildly explosive behaviour over the period. The regression-based indices provide relatively consistent results in terms of the explosive periods in the South African art market, with a potential bubble most likely beginning in 2006 and ending in 2008. The process seemed to be relatively dispersed throughout the market, although prices seem to have been especially explosive for oil paintings by top artists. 

Further research applications might consider the risk-return profile of art as an asset class, and evaluate whether art could form part of an optimal investment portfolio. Conventional wisdom says that the top artworks by established artists tend to outperform the rest of the market [@Mei2002]. This so-called Masterpiece effect could be investigated by looking at different parts of the distribution of art prices. Potential drivers or factors that influence the fluctuations in art prices over time, such as wealth effects, might also be investigated. The quality-adjusted art price indices can facilitate these inquiries and enable one to be more concrete about developments in the South African art market.

##Historical Commodity Prices
The primary aim of this chapter was to develop monthly wholesale commodity price indices for the Cape Colony from 1889 to 1914. The monthly market prices in various towns reported the Agricultural Journals were supplemented with annual market prices reported in the Cape Colony Blue Books. The challenge was that the monthly data was incomplete, in terms of the coverage of both products and towns. The repeat sales method, which is typically used to create indices for infrequently traded items, such as artworks, provides a consistent way to aggregate the price data and produces indices with substantially fewer gaps than in the individual series [@Klovland2014a]. 

The chapter applied the repeat sales method to estimate monthly wholesale commodity price indices for a number of individual products. The product indices were aggregated to form indices of broader product groups and an overall wholesale commodity price index. The weights were based on production values reported in the 1904 census, as well as import values reported in the Blue Books. In general, the wholesale price indices seemed to correspond well with the historical narrative on the economic history of the Cape Colony. Prices seem to have been highly cyclical over the period, with a large increase before and during the Second South African War (1899-1902) and a large decrease up to Unification (1910). 

The wholesale price indices were compared to existing consumer price indices for the Cape Colony and to wholesale price indices for the UK and the US. In both cases the estimated price indices seem plausible, but with a larger increase before the Second South African War (1899-1902). The overall wholesale price index was compared to the available monetary aggregates and seems to better reflect the monetary history of the Cape Colony than the existing CPIs.

Following @Ruch2016, the high-frequency prices were used to gain some insight into the pricing behaviour. Monthly changes were dominated by zero or small changes, with around 86% of changes smaller than 10% in either direction. The frequency of price changes was relatively high, with the prices of goods changing on average every 50 days. This information was used to calculate an alternative measure of inflation, which was decomposed into flexible and sticky components. 

The secondary aim of the chapter was to use the high-frequency price data to investigate internal market integration in the Cape Colony. This chapter built on the work of @Boshoff2015, by expanding the period and the number of products, and focusing specifically on the convergence of market prices. The chapter calculated measures of cross-sectional absolute price gaps and cross-sectional price dispersion between the towns in the Cape Colony. According to these measures, most of the commodity prices were converging over the period, which implies that there was increasing market integration between towns in the Cape Colony, in all likelihood aided by the rapid development of the railway network.

Further research might supplement the indices by including prices from other sources, and potentially import and export prices. Another extension would be to add prices from the other territories in South Africa, i.e. Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, to investigate and compare the price histories of the four territories. Further research could investigate convergence along regional lines or along the main railway lines. Another extension would be to investigate the efficiency dimension of market integration, using time series techniques such as correlations and cointegration. Moreover, the factors that aided the market integration could be investigated, as well as the impact of market integration on welfare and long term growth [@Federico2012]. 

##Contributions
The dissertation has tried to contribute to the literature by demonstrating suitable aggregation and estimation methods to overcome some of the challenges in aggregating the relatively large datasets. In some cases these techniques were applied in the South African literature for the first time. These aggregation techniques may prove useful in a variety of settings or when there are similar challenges. For instance, the weighted cross-sectional moments employed in this dissertation could prove useful for other applications where there are qualitative survey responses. For instance, it might be possible to improve upon the exiting measures of consumer confidence and create new measures of consumer uncertainty.

The repeat sales and hedonic methods employed in this dissertation would be useful in constructing quality-adjusted indices for other unique assets, such as real estate, antiques and wine. ABSA, FNB and Standard Bank currently use stratified central tendency methods to construct their property price indices for South Africa, but this does not adequately control for quality-mix changes and could be improved by using the repeat sales and hedonic methods [@Els2010]. The repeat sales method provides a simple and consistent method to overcome some of the problems of aggregating incomplete information. It may prove useful in other historical applications, where the information is often patchy and incomplete. 

The primary objective of the dissertation was to create useful macroeconomic time series from the relatively large microdata sets: sentiment indices, art price indices, and historical wholesale commodity price indices. The estimated time series are reported in the appendix of each chapter. The hope is that the indicators will prove useful for further research in each of these fields. They are the starting point for further analysis.
